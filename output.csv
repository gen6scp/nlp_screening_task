39367648,An initial game-theoretic assessment of enhanced tissue preparation and imaging protocols for improved deep learning inference of spatial transcriptomics from tissue morphology,"Fatemi MY, Lu Y, Diallo AB, Srinivasan G, Azher ZL, Christensen BC, Salas LA, Tsongalis GJ, Palisoul SM, Perreard L, Kolling FW 4th, Vaickus LJ, Levy JJ.",Brief Bioinform. 2024 Sep 23;25(6):bbae476. doi: 10.1093/bib/bbae476.,Fatemi MY,Brief Bioinform,2024,2024/10/05,PMC11452536,,10.1093/bib/bbae476,"The application of deep learning to spatial transcriptomics (ST) can reveal relationships between gene expression and tissue architecture. Prior work has demonstrated that inferring gene expression from tissue histomorphology can discern these spatial molecular markers to enable population scale studies, reducing the fiscal barriers associated with large-scale spatial profiling. However, while most improvements in algorithmic performance have focused on improving model architectures, little is known about how the quality of tissue preparation and imaging can affect deep learning model training for spatial inference from morphology and its potential for widespread clinical adoption. Prior studies for ST inference from histology typically utilize manually stained frozen sections with imaging on non-clinical grade scanners. Training such models on ST cohorts is also costly. We hypothesize that adopting tissue processing and imaging practices that mirror standards for clinical implementation (permanent sections, automated tissue staining, and clinical grade scanning) can significantly improve model performance. An enhanced specimen processing and imaging protocol was developed for deep learning-based ST inference from morphology. This protocol featured the Visium CytAssist assay to permit automated hematoxylin and eosin staining (e.g. Leica Bond), 40×-resolution imaging, and joining of multiple patients' tissue sections per capture area prior to ST profiling. Using a cohort of 13 pathologic T Stage-III stage colorectal cancer patients, we compared the performance of models trained on slide prepared using enhanced versus traditional (i.e. manual staining and low-resolution imaging) protocols. Leveraging Inceptionv3 neural networks, we predicted gene expression across serial, histologically-matched tissue sections using whole slide images (WSI) from both protocols. The data Shapley was used to quantify and compare marginal performance gains on a patient-by-patient basis attributed to using the enhanced protocol versus the actual costs of spatial profiling. Findings indicate that training and validating on WSI acquired through the enhanced protocol as opposed to the traditional method resulted in improved performance at lower fiscal cost. In the realm of ST, the enhancement of deep learning architectures frequently captures the spotlight; however, the significance of specimen processing and imaging is often understated. This research, informed through a game-theoretic lens, underscores the substantial impact that specimen preparation/imaging can have on spatial transcriptomic inference from morphology. It is essential to integrate such optimized processing protocols to facilitate the identification of prognostic markers at a larger scale.",0.11319309901808164,computer vision,Unknown

However, such data exhibit technical artifacts across batches which introduce confounding and decrease reproducibility. This is especially true when multi-batch data are analyzed using complex downstream models which are more likely to pick up on and implicitly incorporate batch-related information. Previously proposed image harmonization methods have sought to remove these batch effects; however, batch effects remain detectable in the data after applying these methods. We present DeepComBat, a deep learning harmonization method based on a conditional variational autoencoder and the ComBat method. DeepComBat combines the strengths of statistical and deep learning methods in order to account for the multivariate relationships between features while simultaneously relaxing strong assumptions made by previous deep learning harmonization methods. As a result, DeepComBat can perform multivariate harmonization while preserving data structure and avoiding the introduction of synthetic artifacts. We apply this method to cortical thickness measurements from a cognitive-aging cohort and show DeepComBat qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms existing methods in removing batch effects while preserving biological heterogeneity. Additionally, DeepComBat provides a new perspective for statistically motivated deep learning harmonization methods.",0.14960639716341165,computer vision,autoencoder

Construction of GRN in the epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells of cyprinid fish by spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) infection helps understand the immune regulatory mechanisms that enhance the survival capabilities of cyprinid fish. Although many computational methods have been used to infer GRNs, specialized approaches for predicting the GRN of EPC cells following SVCV infection are lacking. In addition, most existing methods focus primarily on gene expression features, neglecting the valuable network structural information in known GRNs. In this study, we propose a novel supervised deep neural network, named MEFFGRN (Matrix Enhancement- and Feature Fusion-based method for Gene Regulatory Network inference), to accurately predict the GRN of EPC cells following SVCV infection. MEFFGRN considers both gene expression data and network structure information of known GRN and introduces a matrix enhancement method to address the sparsity issue of known GRN, extracting richer network structure information. To optimize the benefits of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) in image processing, gene expression and enhanced GRN data were transformed into histogram images for each gene pair respectively. Subsequently, these histograms were separately fed into CNNs for training to obtain the corresponding gene expression and network structural features. Furthermore, a feature fusion mechanism was introduced to comprehensively integrate the gene expression and network structural features. This integration considers the specificity of each feature and their interactive information, resulting in a more comprehensive and precise feature representation during the fusion process. Experimental results from both real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEFFGRN achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art computational methods. Furthermore, study findings from SVCV-infected EPC cells suggest that MEFFGRN can predict novel gene regulatory relationships.",0.13257853488625645,computer vision,CNN

Specifically, the UNet network model is utilized as the base network, and the structure of multi-scale convolutional attention is proposed in the encoder stage to enhance the network's ability to capture multi-scale information. Second, a local channel attention module is proposed to extract spatial information by modeling local relationships to generate channel domain weights, to supplement detailed information about the target region to reduce information redundancy and to enhance important information. Moreover, the network model encoder segment uses the Meta-ACON activation function to avoid the overfitting phenomenon of the model and to improve the model's representational ability.

The high mortality rate of some types of skin cancers needs to be detected in the early stages and treated urgently. The use of neural network ensembles for the detection of objects of interest in images has gained more and more interest due to the increased performance of the results. In this sense, this paper proposes two ensembles of neural networks, based on the fusion of the decisions of the component neural networks for the detection of four skin lesions (basal cancer cell, melanoma, benign keratosis, and melanocytic nevi). The first system is based on separate learning of three neural networks (MobileNet V2, DenseNet 169, and EfficientNet B2), with multiple weights for the four classes of lesions and weighted overall prediction. The second system is made up of six binary models (one for each pair of classes) for each network; the fusion and prediction are conducted by weighted summation per class and per model. In total, 18 such binary models will be considered. The 91.04% global accuracy of this set of binary models is superior to the first system (89.62%). Separately, only for the binary classifications within the system was the individual accuracy better. The individual F1 score for each class and the global system varied from 81.36% to 94.17%.

Unfortunately, there is no consensus on the best way to estimate FPW and unbiased stereology, the current gold standard, is time consuming and not widely available. To address this, we developed an automated FPW estimation technique using deep learning. A U-Net architecture variant model was trained to semantically segment the podocyte-glomerular basement membrane interface and filtration slits. Additionally, we employed a post-processing computer vision approach to accurately estimate FPW. A custom segmentation utility was also created to manually classify these structures on digital electron microscopy (EM) images and to prepare a training dataset. The model was applied to EM images of kidney biopsies from 56 patients with Fabry disease, 15 with type 2 diabetes, 10 with minimal change disease, and 17 normal individuals. The results were compared with unbiased stereology measurements performed by expert technicians unaware of the clinical information. FPW measured by deep learning and by the expert technicians were highly correlated and not statistically different in any of the studied groups. A Bland-Altman plot confirmed interchangeability of the methods. FPW measurement time per biopsy was substantially reduced by deep learning. Thus, we have developed a novel validated deep learning model for FPW measurement on EM images.

However, accurate segmentation of the aorta is required. Thus, our objective is to evaluate the performance of two automatic segmentation methods on the calculation of aortic wall pressure.
METHODS: Automatic segmentation of the aorta was performed with methods based on deep learning and multi-atlas using the systolic phase in the 4D flow MRI magnitude image of 36 patients. Using mesh morphing, isotopological meshes were generated, and CFD was performed to calculate the aortic wall pressure. Node-to-node comparisons of the pressure results were made to identify the most robust automatic method respect to the pressures obtained with a manually segmented model.
RESULTS: Deep learning approach presented the best segmentation performance with a mean Dice similarity coefficient and a mean Hausdorff distance (HD) equal to 0.92+/- 0.02 and 21.02+/- 24.20 mm, respectively. At the global level HD is affected by the performance in the abdominal aorta. Locally, this distance decreases to 9.41+/- 3.45 and 5.82+/- 6.23 for the ascending and descending thoracic aorta, respectively. Moreover, with respect to the pressures from the manual segmentations, the differences in the pressures computed from deep learning were lower than those computed from multi-atlas method.

This study compares different strategies for automatic segmentation of the prostate in T2-weighted MRIs.
METHODS: This study included 100 patients diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma who had undergone multi-parametric MRI and prostatectomy. From the T2-weighted MR images, ground truth segmentation masks were established by consensus from two expert radiologists. The prostate was then automatically contoured with six different methods: (1) a multi-atlas algorithm, (2) a proprietary algorithm in the Syngo.Via medical imaging software, and four deep learning models: (3) a V-net trained from scratch, (4) a pre-trained 2D U-net, (5) a GAN extension of the 2D U-net, and (6) a segmentation-adapted EfficientDet architecture. The resulting segmentations were compared and scored against the ground truth masks with one 70/30 and one 50/50 train/test data split. We also analyzed the association between segmentation performance and clinical variables.
RESULTS: The best performing method was the adapted EfficientDet (model 6), achieving a mean Dice coefficient of 0.914, a mean absolute volume difference of 5.9%, a mean surface distance (MSD) of 1.93 pixels, and a mean 95th percentile Hausdorff distance of 3.77 pixels. The deep learning models were less prone to serious errors (0.854 minimum Dice and 4.02 maximum MSD), and no significant relationship was found between segmentation performance and clinical variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning-based segmentation techniques can consistently achieve Dice coefficients of 0.9 or above with as few as 50 training patients, regardless of architectural archetype. The atlas-based and Syngo.via methods found in commercial clinical software performed significantly worse (0.855[Formula: see text]0.887 Dice).",0.11363928793718851,computer vision,GAN

Apart from their scientific merit, these models are often used to inform political decisions and interventional measures during an ongoing outbreak. However, reliably inferring the epidemical dynamics by connecting complex models to real data is still hard and requires either laborious manual parameter fitting or expensive optimization methods which have to be repeated from scratch for every application of a given model. In this work, we address this problem with a novel combination of epidemiological modeling with specialized neural networks. Our approach entails two computational phases: In an initial training phase, a mathematical model describing the epidemic is used as a coach for a neural network, which acquires global knowledge about the full range of possible disease dynamics. In the subsequent inference phase, the trained neural network processes the observed data of an actual outbreak and infers the parameters of the model in order to realistically reproduce the observed dynamics and reliably predict future progression. With its flexible framework, our simulation-based approach is applicable to a variety of epidemiological models. Moreover, since our method is fully Bayesian, it is designed to incorporate all available prior knowledge about plausible parameter values and returns complete joint posterior distributions over these parameters.

The deviation between estimated brain age and biological age is an established biomarker of brain health and such models may benefit from increased cross-site generalizability.
PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate a deep learning-based image harmonization method to improve cross-site generalizability of deep learning age prediction.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.
POPULATION: Eight thousand eight hundred and seventy-six subjects from six sites. Harmonization models were trained using all subjects. Age prediction models were trained using 2739 subjects from a single site and tested using the remaining 6137 subjects from various other sites.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Brain imaging with magnetization prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo or spoiled gradient echo sequences at 1.5 T and 3 T.
ASSESSMENT: StarGAN v2, was used to perform a canonical mapping from diverse datasets to a reference domain to reduce site-based variation while preserving semantic information. Generalization performance of deep learning age prediction was evaluated using harmonized, histogram matched, and unharmonized data.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson correlation between estimated age and biological age quantified the performance of the age prediction model.
RESULTS: Our results indicated a substantial improvement in age prediction in out-of-sample data, with the overall MAE improving from 15.81 (±0.21) years to 11.86 (±0.11) with histogram matching to 7.21 (±0.22) years with generative adversarial network (GAN)-based harmonization. In the multisite case, across the 5 out-of-sample sites, MAE improved from 9.78 (±6.69) years to 7.74 (±3.03) years with histogram normalization to 5.32 (±4.07) years with GAN-based harmonization.
DATA CONCLUSION: While further research is needed, GAN-based medical image harmonization appears to be a promising tool for improving cross-site deep learning generalization.

METHODS: One hundred fifty-four OPSCC patients who received pretreatment FDG-PET were included and divided into training (n = 102) and test (n = 52) sets. The diagnosis of local failure and local progression-free survival (PFS) rates were obtained from patient medical records. In deep learning analyses, axial and coronal images were assessed by three different architectures (AlexNet, GoogLeNET, and ResNet). In the training set, FDG-PET images were analyzed after the data augmentation process for the diagnostic model creation. A multivariate clinical model was also created using a binomial logistic regression model from a patient's clinical characteristics. The test data set was subsequently analyzed for confirmation of diagnostic accuracy. Assessment of local PFS rates was also performed.
RESULTS: Training sessions were successfully performed with an accuracy of 74-89%. ROC curve analyses revealed an AUC of 0.61-0.85 by the deep learning model in the test set, whereas it was 0.62 by T-stage, 0.59 by clinical stage, and 0.74 by a multivariate clinical model. The highest AUC (0.85) was obtained with deep learning analysis of ResNet architecture. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed deep learning-based classification by a multivariate clinical model (P < .05), and ResNet (P < .001) was a significant predictor of the treatment outcome. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the deep learning-based classification divided the patient's local PFS rate better than the T-stage, clinical stage, and a multivariate clinical model.

However, the broader applicability of retinal photograph-based deep learning for predicting other systemic biomarkers and the generalisability of this approach to various populations remains unexplored.
METHODS: With use of 236 257 retinal photographs from seven diverse Asian and European cohorts (two health screening centres in South Korea, the Beijing Eye Study, three cohorts in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study, and the UK Biobank), we evaluated the capacities of 47 deep-learning algorithms to predict 47 systemic biomarkers as outcome variables, including demographic factors (age and sex); body composition measurements; blood pressure; haematological parameters; lipid profiles; biochemical measures; biomarkers related to liver function, thyroid function, kidney function, and inflammation; and diabetes. The standard neural network architecture of VGG16 was adopted for model development.
FINDINGS: In addition to previously reported systemic biomarkers, we showed quantification of body composition indices (muscle mass, height, and bodyweight) and creatinine from retinal photographs. Body muscle mass could be predicted with an R2 of 0·52 (95% CI 0·51-0·53) in the internal test set, and of 0·33 (0·30-0·35) in one external test set with muscle mass measurement available. The R2 value for the prediction of height was 0·42 (0·40-0·43), of bodyweight was 0·36 (0·34-0·37), and of creatinine was 0·38 (0·37-0·40) in the internal test set. However, the performances were poorer in external test sets (with the lowest performance in the European cohort), with R2 values ranging between 0·08 and 0·28 for height, 0·04 and 0·19 for bodyweight, and 0·01 and 0·26 for creatinine. Of the 47 systemic biomarkers, 37 could not be predicted well from retinal photographs via deep learning (R2≤0·14 across all external test sets).
INTERPRETATION: Our work provides new insights into the potential use of retinal photographs to predict systemic biomarkers, including body composition indices and serum creatinine, using deep learning in populations with a similar ethnic background. Further evaluations are warranted to validate these findings and evaluate the clinical utility of these algorithms.

METHODS: This research employs the advantages of computer vision and medical image analysis to develop an automated model that has the clinical potential for early detection of the disease. Using Deep Learning models, the research aims at evaluating the effectiveness and accuracy of different convolutional neural networks models in the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from X-ray images as compared to diagnosis performed by experts in the medical community.
RESULTS: Due to the fact that the dataset available for COVID-19 is still limited, the best model to use is the InceptionNetV3. Performance results show that the InceptionNetV3 model yielded the highest accuracy of 98.63% (with data augmentation) and 98.90% (without data augmentation) among the three models designed. However, as the dataset gets bigger, the Inception ResNetV2 and NASNetlarge will do a better job of classification. All the performed networks tend to over-fit when data augmentation is not used, this is due to the small amount of data used for training and validation.
CONCLUSION: A deep transfer learning is proposed to detecting the COVID-19 automatically from chest X-ray by training it with X-ray images gotten from both COVID-19 patients and people with normal chest X-rays.

This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network fusion support vector machine algorithm (DCNN-F-SVM). The proposed brain tumor segmentation model is mainly divided into three stages. In the first stage, a deep convolutional neural network is trained to learn the mapping from image space to tumor marker space. In the second stage, the predicted labels obtained from the deep convolutional neural network training are input into the integrated support vector machine classifier together with the test images. In the third stage, a deep convolutional neural network and an integrated support vector machine are connected in series to train a deep classifier.

In particular, MRI-derived brain age has been used as a comprehensive biomarker of brain health that can identify both advanced and resilient ageing individuals via deviations from typical brain ageing. Imaging signatures of various brain diseases, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, have also been identified using machine learning. Prior efforts to derive these indices have been hampered by the need for sophisticated and not easily reproducible processing steps, by insufficiently powered or diversified samples from which typical brain ageing trajectories were derived, and by limited reproducibility across populations and MRI scanners. Herein, we develop and test a sophisticated deep brain network (DeepBrainNet) using a large (n = 11 729) set of MRI scans from a highly diversified cohort spanning different studies, scanners, ages and geographic locations around the world. Tests using both cross-validation and a separate replication cohort of 2739 individuals indicate that DeepBrainNet obtains robust brain-age estimates from these diverse datasets without the need for specialized image data preparation and processing. Furthermore, we show evidence that moderately fit brain ageing models may provide brain age estimates that are most discriminant of individuals with pathologies. This is not unexpected as tightly-fitting brain age models naturally produce brain-age estimates that offer little information beyond age, and loosely fitting models may contain a lot of noise. Our results offer some experimental evidence against commonly pursued tightly-fitting models. We show that the moderately fitting brain age models obtain significantly higher differentiation compared to tightly-fitting models in two of the four disease groups tested. Critically, we demonstrate that leveraging DeepBrainNet, along with transfer learning, allows us to construct more accurate classifiers of several brain diseases, compared to directly training classifiers on patient versus healthy control datasets or using common imaging databases such as ImageNet. We, therefore, derive a domain-specific deep network likely to reduce the need for application-specific adaptation and tuning of generic deep learning networks.

We used a weakly-supervised approach without pixel-level annotations, and tested three different survival loss functions. The DLS was developed using 9,086 slides from 3,664 cases and evaluated using 3,009 slides from 1,216 cases. In multivariable Cox regression analysis of the combined cohort including all 10 cancers, the DLS was significantly associated with disease specific survival (hazard ratio of 1.58, 95% CI 1.28-1.70, p<0.0001) after adjusting for cancer type, stage, age, and sex. In a per-cancer adjusted subanalysis, the DLS remained a significant predictor of survival in 5 of 10 cancer types. Compared to a baseline model including stage, age, and sex, the c-index of the model demonstrated an absolute 3.7% improvement (95% CI 1.0-6.5) in the combined cohort. Additionally, our models stratified patients within individual cancer stages, particularly stage II (p = 0.025) and stage III (p<0.001). By developing and evaluating prognostic models across multiple cancer types, this work represents one of the most comprehensive studies exploring the direct prediction of clinical outcomes using deep learning and histopathology images. Our analysis demonstrates the potential for this approach to provide significant prognostic information in multiple cancer types, and even within specific pathologic stages. However, given the relatively small number of cases and observed clinical events for a deep learning task of this type, we observed wide confidence intervals for model performance, thus highlighting that future work will benefit from larger datasets assembled for the purposes for survival modeling.",0.12390901108267649,computer vision,Unknown

A number of convolutional neural network-based methodologies have been proposed to accurately analyze histopathological images for cancer detection, risk prediction, and cancer subtype classification. Most existing methods have conducted patch-based examinations, due to the extremely large size of histopathological images. However, patches of a small window often do not contain sufficient information or patterns for the tasks of interest. It corresponds that pathologists also examine tissues at various magnification levels, while checking complex morphological patterns in a microscope. We propose a novel multi-task based deep learning model for HIstoPatholOgy (named Deep-Hipo) that takes multi-scale patches simultaneously for accurate histopathological image analysis. Deep-Hipo extracts two patches of the same size in both high and low magnification levels, and captures complex morphological patterns in both large and small receptive fields of a whole-slide image. Deep-Hipo has outperformed the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods. We assessed the proposed method in various types of whole-slide images of the stomach: well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated, and poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma; poorly cohesive carcinoma, including signet-ring cell features; and normal gastric mucosa. The optimally trained model was also applied to histopathological images of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Stomach Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-STAD) and TCGA Colon Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-COAD), which show similar pathological patterns with gastric carcinoma, and the experimental results were clinically verified by a pathologist.

Originally designed for pattern recognition and image processing, Deep Learning models are now applied to survival prognosis of cancer patients. Specifically, Deep Learning versions of the Cox proportional hazards models are trained with transcriptomic data to predict survival outcomes in cancer patients.
METHODS: In this study, a broad analysis was performed on TCGA cancers using a variety of Deep Learning-based models, including Cox-nnet, DeepSurv, and a method proposed by our group named AECOX (AutoEncoder with Cox regression network). Concordance index and p-value of the log-rank test are used to evaluate the model performances.
RESULTS: All models show competitive results across 12 cancer types. The last hidden layers of the Deep Learning approaches are lower dimensional representations of the input data that can be used for feature reduction and visualization. Furthermore, the prognosis performances reveal a negative correlation between model accuracy, overall survival time statistics, and tumor mutation burden (TMB), suggesting an association among overall survival time, TMB, and prognosis prediction accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep Learning based algorithms demonstrate superior performances than traditional machine learning based models. The cancer prognosis results measured in concordance index are indistinguishable across models while are highly variable across cancers.

METHOD: The investigation was carried out within the SOS clinical trial (NCT03645018) for lung cancer screening with DTS. Lung nodules were identified by visual analysis and then classified using the diameter and the radiological aspect of the nodule following lung-RADS. Haralick texture features were extracted from the segmented nodules. Both semantic variables and radiomics features were used to build a predictive model using logistic regression on a subset of variables selected with backward feature selection and using two machine learning: a Random Forest and a neural network with the whole subset of variables. The methods were applied to a train set and validated on a test set where diagnostic accuracy metrics were calculated.
RESULTS: Binary visual analysis had a good sensitivity (0.95) but a low PPV (0.14). Lung-RADS classification increased the PPV (0.19) but with an unacceptable low sensitivity (0.65). Logistic regression showed a mildly increased PPV (0.29) but a lower sensitivity (0.20). Random Forest demonstrated a moderate PPV (0.40) but with a low sensitivity (0.30). Neural network demonstrated to be the best predictor with a high PPV (0.95) and a high sensitivity (0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: The neural network demonstrated the best PPV. The use of visual analysis along with neural network could help radiologists to reduce the number of false positive in DTS.

Furthermore, when such bulk assays as RNA sequencing are performed, intratumoral heterogeneity that may affect prognosis and therapeutic decision-making can be missed.
METHODS: As a more facile and readily available method for determining IMS in breast cancer, we developed a deep learning approach for approximating PAM50 intrinsic subtyping using only whole-slide images of H&E-stained breast biopsy tissue sections. This algorithm was trained on images from 443 tumors that had previously undergone PAM50 subtyping to classify small patches of the images into four major molecular subtypes-Basal-like, HER2-enriched, Luminal A, and Luminal B-as well as Basal vs. non-Basal. The algorithm was subsequently used for subtype classification of a held-out set of 222 tumors.
RESULTS: This deep learning image-based classifier correctly subtyped the majority of samples in the held-out set of tumors. However, in many cases, significant heterogeneity was observed in assigned subtypes across patches from within a single whole-slide image. We performed further analysis of heterogeneity, focusing on contrasting Luminal A and Basal-like subtypes because classifications from our deep learning algorithm-similar to PAM50-are associated with significant differences in survival between these two subtypes. Patients with tumors classified as heterogeneous were found to have survival intermediate between Luminal A and Basal patients, as well as more varied levels of hormone receptor expression patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present a method for minimizing manual work required to identify cancer-rich patches among all multiscale patches in H&E-stained WSIs that can be generalized to any indication. These results suggest that advanced deep machine learning methods that use only routinely collected whole-slide images can approximate RNA-seq-based molecular tests such as PAM50 and, importantly, may increase detection of heterogeneous tumors that may require more detailed subtype analysis.",0.12175747676667509,computer vision,Unknown

METHODS: Full-field digital screening mammograms acquired in our clinics between 2006 and 2015 were reviewed. Transfer learning of a deep learning network with weights initialized from ImageNet was performed to classify mammograms that were followed by an invasive interval or screen-detected cancer within 12 months of the mammogram. Hyperparameter optimization was performed and the network was visualized through saliency maps. Prediction loss and accuracy were calculated using this deep learning network. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values were generated with the outcome of interval cancer using the deep learning network and compared to predictions from conditional logistic regression with errors quantified through contingency tables.
RESULTS: Pre-cancer mammograms of 182 interval and 173 screen-detected cancers were split into training/test cases at an 80/20 ratio. Using Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density alone, the ability to correctly classify interval cancers was moderate (AUC = 0.65). The optimized deep learning model achieved an AUC of 0.82. Contingency table analysis showed the network was correctly classifying 75.2% of the mammograms and that incorrect classifications were slightly more common for the interval cancer mammograms. Saliency maps of each cancer case found that local information could highly drive classification of cases more than global image information.

Deep neural networks have emerged recently as de facto standard detection methods, but their drawback is the need of large annotated datasets. Finetuning pre-trained networks is a viable alternative, but it is not clear a priori if training with small annotated datasets will be successful, as it depends on the problem at hand. In this paper, we show that pre-trained networks can be utilized to produce an effective detector of ossification areas in pediatric X-ray images of hands.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A publicly available Faster R-CNN network, pre-trained on the COCO dataset, was utilized and finetuned with 240 manually annotated radiographs from the RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Challenge, which comprises over 14.000 pediatric radiographs. The validation is done on another 89 radiographs from the dataset and the performance is measured by Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To understand the effect of the data size on the pre-trained network, subsampling was applied to the training data and the training was repeated. Additionally, the network was trained from scratch without any pre-trained weights. Finally, to understand whether the trained model could be useful, we compared the inference of the network to an annotation of an expert radiologist. The finetuned network was able to achieve an average precision (mAP@0.5IoU) of 92.92 ± 1.93. Apart from the wrist region, all ossification areas were able to benefit from more data. In contrast, the network trained from scratch was not able to produce any correct results. When compared to the annotations of the expert radiologist, the network was able to localize the regions quite well, as the F1-Score was on average 91.85 ± 1.06.
CONCLUSIONS: By finetuning a pre-trained deep neural network, with 240 annotated radiographs, we were able to successfully detect ossification areas in prediatric hand radiographs.",0.16568484434451675,computer vision,CNN

This study aimed to investigate the revolutionary deep learning methods to distinguish recalled but benign mammography images from negative exams and those with malignancy.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed to classify mammography images into malignant (breast cancer), negative (breast cancer free), and recalled-benign categories. A total of 14,860 images of 3,715 patients from two independent mammography datasets: Full-Field Digital Mammography Dataset (FFDM) and a digitized film dataset, Digital Dataset of Screening Mammography (DDSM), were used in various settings for training and testing the CNN models. The ROC curve was generated and the AUC was calculated as a metric of the classification accuracy.
RESULTS: Training and testing using only the FFDM dataset resulted in AUC ranging from 0.70 to 0.81. When the DDSM dataset was used, AUC ranged from 0.77 to 0.96. When datasets were combined for training and testing, AUC ranged from 0.76 to 0.91. When pretrained on a large nonmedical dataset and DDSM, the models showed consistent improvements in AUC ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 (all P &gt; 0.05), compared with pretraining only on the nonmedical dataset.

RECENT FINDINGS: Supervised machine learning can allow us to better predict diabetes-induced osteoporosis and understand relative predictor importance of diabetes-affected bone tissue. Unsupervised machine learning can allow us to understand patterns in data between diabetic pathophysiology and altered bone metabolism. Image analysis using deep learning can allow us to be less dependent on surrogate predictors and use large volumes of images to classify diabetes-induced osteoporosis and predict future outcomes directly from images.

METHODS: We conducted a population-based study, the Montrachet study (Maculopathy Optic Nerve nuTRition neurovAsCular and HEarT diseases), in participants older than 75 years. The history of cardiovascular disease and a score-based estimation of their 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality (Heart SCORE) were collected. Retinal vascular network analysis was performed by means of Singapore ""I"" Vessel Assessment (SIVA) software. Principal component analysis was used to condense the information contained in the high number of variables provided and to identify independent retinal vascular patterns.
RESULTS: Overall, 1069 photographs (1069 participants) were reviewed with SIVA software. The mean age was 80.0 ± 3.8 years. We extracted three vascular patterns summarizing 41.3% of the vascular information. The most clinically relevant pattern, Sparse vascular network, accounted for 17.4% of the total variance. It corresponded to a lower density in the vascular network and higher variability in vessel width. Diabetic participants with hypoglycemic treatment had a sparser vascular network pattern than subjects without such treatment (odds ratio, [OR], 1.68; 95% CI, 1.04-2.72; P = 0.04). Participants with no history of cardiovascular disease who had a sparser vascular network were associated with a higher Heart SCORE (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.08-2.25; P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Three vascular patterns were identified. The Sparse vascular network pattern was associated with having a higher risk profile for cardiovascular mortality risk at 10 years.",0.12488129178194685,other,Principal component analysis

However, the interpretation of patient movements has subjective and intrinsic challenges. In this paper, we develop approaches to attempt to automatically extract and classify semiological patterns from facial expressions. We address limitations of existing computer-based analytical approaches of epilepsy monitoring, where facial movements have largely been ignored. This is an area that has seen limited advances in the literature. Inspired by recent advances in deep learning, we propose two deep learning models, landmark-based and region-based, to quantitatively identify changes in facial semiology in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) from spontaneous expressions during phase I monitoring. A dataset has been collected from the Mater Advanced Epilepsy Unit (Brisbane, Australia) and is used to evaluate our proposed approach. Our experiments show that a landmark-based approach achieves promising results in analyzing facial semiology, where movements can be effectively marked and tracked when there is a frontal face on visualization. However, the region-based counterpart with spatiotemporal features achieves more accurate results when confronted with extreme head positions. A multifold cross-validation of the region-based approach exhibited an average test accuracy of 95.19% and an average AUC of 0.98 of the ROC curve. Conversely, a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme for the same approach reveals a reduction in accuracy for the model as it is affected by data limitations and achieves an average test accuracy of 50.85%. Overall, the proposed deep learning models have shown promise in quantifying ictal facial movements in patients with MTLE. In turn, this may serve to enhance the automated presurgical epilepsy evaluation by allowing for standardization, mitigating bias, and assessing key features. The computer-aided diagnosis may help to support clinical decision-making and prevent erroneous localization and surgery.",0.10453032402101718,other,Unknown

This study comprised a discovery data set of 75 patients and an independent validation data set of 37 patients. A total of 1403 handcrafted features and 98304 deep features were extracted from preoperative multi-modality MR images. After feature selection, a six-deep-feature signature was constructed by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model. A radiomics nomogram was further presented by combining the signature and clinical risk factors such as age and Karnofsky Performance Score. Compared with traditional risk factors, the proposed signature achieved better performance for prediction of OS (C-index = 0.710, 95% CI: 0.588, 0.932) and significant stratification of patients into prognostically distinct groups (P < 0.001, HR = 5.128, 95% CI: 2.029, 12.960).

We applied longitudinal resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to delineate functional brain connections relevant for disease progression and diagnostic accuracy.
METHODS: We used two-center resting state fMRI data of 20 AD patients (65.1±8.0 years), 12 bvFTD patients (64.7±5.4 years), and 22 control subjects (63.8±5.0 years) at baseline and 1.8-year follow-up. We used whole-network and voxel-based network-to-region analyses to study group differences in functional connectivity at baseline and follow-up, and longitudinal changes in connectivity within and between groups.
RESULTS: At baseline, connectivity between paracingulate gyrus and executive control network, between cuneal cortex and medial visual network, and between paracingulate gyrus and salience network was higher in AD compared with controls. These differences were also present after 1.8 years. At follow-up, connectivity between angular gyrus and right frontoparietal network, and between paracingulate gyrus and default mode network was lower in bvFTD compared with controls, and lower compared with AD between anterior cingulate gyrus and executive control network, and between lateral occipital cortex and medial visual network. Over time, connectivity decreased in AD between precuneus and right frontoparietal network and in bvFTD between inferior frontal gyrus and left frontoparietal network. Longitudinal changes in connectivity between supramarginal gyrus and right frontoparietal network differ between both patient groups and controls.

We used structural magnetic resonance imaging data of 31 AD patients, 24 bvFTD patients, and 30 controls from two centers specialized in dementia. Ten SCNs were defined based on structural covariance of gray matter density using independent component analysis. We studied group differences in SCNs using F-tests, with Bonferroni corrected t-tests, adjusted for age, gender, and study center. Associations with cognitive performance were studied using linear regression analyses. Cross-sectional group differences were found in three SCNs (all P < 0.0025). In bvFTD, we observed decreased anterior cingulate network integrity compared with AD and controls. Patients with AD showed decreased precuneal network integrity compared with bvFTD and controls, and decreased hippocampal network and anterior cingulate network integrity compared with controls. In AD, we found an association between precuneal network integrity and global cognitive performance (P = 0.0043). Our findings show that AD and bvFTD target different SCNs. The comparison of both types of dementia showed decreased precuneal (i.e., default mode) network integrity in AD and decreased anterior cingulate (i.e., salience) network integrity in bvFTD.

The author looks at where we have been and where we are going in this enterprise and the role that structure plays in defining ever more ambitious biological questions and testing and refining models that incorporate data from many techniques. In this, essentially, personal account, the author reflects on 35 years of structural virology and the stages experienced; from ""stand alone"" crystallography of virus particles to the study of virus assembly and maturation in vitro and eventually into the entire virus infection process from particle cell entry to egress. In the process data from many sources were incorporated into reasonable and testable models based on structures ranging in resolution from near-atomic determined by crystallography, to nanometer, determined by electron cryo-microscopy and image reconstruction, to five nanometer tomographic studies in the cell. The technological development over this period, for structural studies at all resolutions and functional studies that were unimaginable three decades ago, has been astonishing.

METHODS: The cortical circumferential profiling (CCP) technique was used to extract information regarding patterns of cortical perfusion. Traditional analysis of the CCP data, taken from slices at the level of the basal ganglia, indicated significant perfusion deficits for Alzheimer's disease patients relative to normals, particularly in the left temporo-parietal and left posterior frontal areas of the cortex. The compressed profiles were then used to train a neural-network classifier, the performance of which was compared with that of a number of more traditional statistical (discriminant function) techniques and that of two expert viewers.
RESULTS: The optimal classification performance of the neural network (ROC area = 0.91) was better than that of the alternative statistical techniques (max. ROC area = 0.85) and that of the expert viewers (max. ROC area = 0.79).

A major future application of digital techniques is computer-assisted diagnosis: the use of computer techniques to assist the radiologist in the diagnostic process. One aspect of this assistance is computer-assisted detection. The detection of small lung nodule has been recognized as a clinically difficult task for many years. Most of the literature has indicated that the rate for finding lung nodules (size range from 3 mm to 15 mm) is only approximately 65%, in those cases in which the undetected nodules could be found retrospectively. In recent published research, image processing techniques, such as thresholding and morphological analysis, have been used to enhance true-positive detection. However, these methods still produce many false-positive detections. We have been investigating the use of neural networks to distinguish true-positives nodule detections among those areas of interest that are generated from a signal enhanced image. The initial results show that the trained neural networks program can increase true-positive detections and moderately reduce the number of false-positive detections. The program reported here can perform three modes of lung nodule detection: thresholding, profile matching analysis, and neural network. This program is fully automatic and has been implemented in a DEC 5000/200 (Digital Equipment Corp, Maynard, MA) workstation. The total processing time for all three methods is less than 35 seconds.

SAPPNet consists of spatial convolution modules which are designed to extract spatial dependencies includes categorical and numerical attributes that represent static features (gender, level/year, age, digital tools used before and after COVID-19, psychological condition using prolonged e-learning tools) and temporal module for temporal dependencies involves sequences that capture changes before and after COVID-19. Additionally, we also try to implement classical machine learning (ML) models including support vector machine, k nearest neighbor, decision tree, and random forest, and DL models named artificial neural network, convolutional neural network, long short-term memory, and students learning prediction network.

Deep learning can provide automated quantification of coronary plaque from computed tomography angiography. We determined per-patient age- and sex-specific distributions of deep learning-based plaque measurements and further evaluated their risk prediction for myocardial infarction in external samples.
METHODS: In this international, multicenter study of 2803 patients, a previously validated deep learning system was used to quantify coronary plaque from computed tomography angiography. Age- and sex-specific distributions of coronary plaque volume were determined from 956 patients undergoing computed tomography angiography for stable coronary artery disease from 5 cohorts. Multicenter external samples were used to evaluate associations between coronary plaque percentiles and myocardial infarction.
RESULTS: Quantitative deep learning plaque volumes increased with age and were higher in male patients. In the combined external sample (n=1847), patients in the ≥75th percentile of total plaque volume (unadjusted hazard ratio, 2.65 [95% CI, 1.47-4.78]; P=0.001) were at increased risk of myocardial infarction compared with patients below the 50th percentile. Similar relationships were seen for most plaque volumes and persisted in multivariable analyses adjusting for clinical characteristics, coronary artery calcium, stenosis, and plaque volume, with adjusted hazard ratios ranging from 2.38 to 2.50 for patients in the ≥75th percentile of total plaque volume.

The deep learning model accurately estimated MMSE and BHQ from these inputs, with age, nutritional information, and organ function indicators being top predictors. These findings highlight the relationship of dementia with systemic metabolic disorders and suggest the potential of using routine blood tests for dementia risk assessment.

Identifying infected patients early with the support of predictive models helps dialysis centers implement concerted procedures (e.g., temperature screenings, universal masking, isolation treatments) to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate outbreaks. We collect data from multiple sources, including demographics, clinical, treatment, laboratory, vaccination, socioeconomic status, and COVID-19 surveillance. Previous early prediction models, such as logistic regression, SVM, and XGBoost, require sophisticated feature engineering and need improved prediction performance. We create deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to predict SARS-CoV-2 infections during incubation. Our study shows deep learning models with minimal feature engineering can identify those infected patients more accurately than previously built models. Our Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model consistently performed well, with an AUC exceeding 0.80, peaking at 0.91 in August 2021. The CNN model also demonstrated strong results with an AUC above 0.75. Both models outperformed previous best XGBoost models by over 0.10 in AUC. Prediction accuracy declined as the pandemic evolved, dropping to approximately 0.75 between September 2021 and January 2022. Maintaining a 20% false positive rate, our LSTM and CNN models identified 66% and 64% of positive cases among patients, significantly outperforming XGBoost models at 42%. We also identify key features for dialysis patients by calculating the gradient of the output with respect to the input features. By closely monitoring these factors, dialysis patients can receive earlier diagnoses and care, leading to less severe outcomes.

Different data modalities provide complementary information that can be leveraged to gain a more complete understanding of each subject. In the biomedical domain, multi-omics data includes molecular (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, etc.) and imaging (radiomics, pathomics) modalities which, when combined, have the potential to improve performance on prediction, classification, clustering and other tasks. Deep learning encompasses a wide variety of methods, each of which have certain strengths and weaknesses for multi-omics integration.
METHOD: In this review, we categorize recent deep learning-based approaches by their basic architectures and discuss their unique capabilities in relation to one another. We also discuss some emerging themes advancing the field of multi-omics integration.
RESULTS: Deep learning-based multi-omics integration methods were categorized broadly into non-generative (feedforward neural networks, graph convolutional neural networks, and autoencoders) and generative (variational methods, generative adversarial models, and a generative pretrained model). Generative methods have the advantage of being able to impose constraints on the shared representations to enforce certain properties or incorporate prior knowledge. They can also be used to generate or impute missing modalities. Recent advances achieved by these methods include the ability to handle incomplete data as well as going beyond the traditional molecular omics data types to integrate other modalities such as imaging data.
CONCLUSION: We expect to see further growth in methods that can handle missingness, as this is a common challenge in working with complex and heterogeneous data. Additionally, methods that integrate more data types are expected to improve performance on downstream tasks by capturing a comprehensive view of each sample.",0.15065112362898636,computer vision,Unknown

RESULTS: The deep learning model exhibited the highest performance in predicting incisional infection, followed by random forest and logistic regression models. Specifically, the deep learning model demonstrated higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and F1 score compared to other models. These findings suggest the efficacy of machine learning models in predicting risk factors for incisional infection following right hemicolectomy for colon cancer.

Epub 2024 Aug 30.,Huang J,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2024,2024/09/05,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108403,"BACKGROUND: Acute heart failure (AHF) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is characterized by its criticality, rapid progression, complex and changeable condition, and its pathophysiological process involves the interaction of multiple organs and systems. This makes it difficult to predict in-hospital mortality events comprehensively and accurately. Traditional analysis methods based on statistics and machine learning suffer from insufficient model performance, poor accuracy caused by prior dependence, and difficulty in adequately considering the complex relationships between multiple risk factors. Therefore, the application of deep neural network (DNN) techniques to the specific scenario, predicting mortality events of patients with AHF under intensive care, has become a research frontier.
METHODS: This research utilized the MIMIC-IV critical care database as the primary data source and employed the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset. Deep neural network models-backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), which are based on electronic medical record data mining, were employed to investigate the in-hospital death event judgment task of patients with AHF under intensive care. Additionally, multiple single machine learning models and ensemble learning models were constructed for comparative experiments. Moreover, we achieved various optimal performance combinations by modifying the classification threshold of deep neural network models to address the diverse real-world requirements in the ICU. Finally, we conducted an interpretable deep model using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover the most influential medical record features for each patient from the aspects of global and local interpretation.
RESULTS: In terms of model performance in this scenario, deep neural network models outperform both single machine learning models and ensemble learning models, achieving the highest Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 value, and Area under the ROC curve, which can reach 0.949, 0.925, 0.983, 0.953, and 0.987 respectively. SHAP value analysis revealed that the ICU scores (APSIII, OASIS, SOFA) are significantly correlated with the occurrence of in-hospital fatal events.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores that DNN-based mortality event classifier offers a novel intelligent approach for forecasting and assessing the prognosis of AHF patients in the ICU. Additionally, the ICU scores stand out as the most predictive features, which implies that in the decision-making process of the models, ICU scores can provide the most crucial information, making the greatest positive or negative contribution to influence the incidence of in-hospital mortality among patients with acute heart failure.",0.20422977468475562,other,RNN

Our study aims to develop a model based on multimodal MRI by using radiomics and deep learning to predict the treatment response in CC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT). From August 2009 to June 2013, CC patients in stage Ib2-IIb (FIGO 2008) who received NACRT at Fujian Cancer Hospital were enrolled in our study. Clinical information, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI), and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) data were respectively collected. Radiomic features and deep abstract features were extracted from the images using radiomics and deep learning models, respectively. Then, ElasticNet and SVM-RFE were employed for feature selection to construct four single-sequence feature sets. Early fusion of two multi-sequence feature sets and one hybrid feature set were performed, followed by classification prediction using four machine learning classifiers. Subsequently, the performance of the models in predicting the response to NACRT was evaluated by separating patients into training and validation sets. Additionally, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Among the four machine learning models, SVM exhibited the best predictive performance (AUC=0.86).

Accurate prediction of influenza activity is crucial for reducing its impact. Therefore, this study seeks to develop a hybrid Convolution Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory neural network (CNN-LSTM) model to forecast the percentage of influenza-like-illness (ILI) rate in Hebei Province, China. The aim is to provide more precise guidance for influenza prevention and control measures.
METHODS: Using ILI% data from 28 national sentinel hospitals in the Hebei Province, spanning from 2010 to 2022, we employed the Python deep learning framework PyTorch to develop the CNN-LSTM model. Additionally, we utilized R and Python to develop four other models commonly used for predicting infectious diseases. After constructing the models, we employed these models to make retrospective predictions, and compared each model's prediction performance using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and other evaluation metrics.
RESULTS: Based on historical ILI% data from 28 national sentinel hospitals in Hebei Province, the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Indagate Moving Average (SARIMA), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM) models were constructed. On the testing set, all models effectively predicted the ILI% trends. Subsequently, these models were used to forecast over different time spans. Across various forecasting periods, the CNN-LSTM model demonstrated the best predictive performance, followed by the XGBoost model, LSTM model, CNN model, and SARIMA model, which exhibited the least favorable performance.

Model evaluations commonly report performance genome-wide; however, cis regulatory elements (CREs), which play critical roles in gene regulation, make up only a small fraction of the genome. Furthermore, cell type-specific CREs contain a large proportion of complex disease heritability.
RESULTS: We evaluate genomic deep learning models in chromatin accessibility regions with varying degrees of cell type specificity. We assess two modeling directions in the field: general purpose models trained across thousands of outputs (cell types and epigenetic marks) and models tailored to specific tissues and tasks. We find that the accuracy of genomic deep learning models, including two state-of-the-art general purpose models-Enformer and Sei-varies across the genome and is reduced in cell type-specific accessible regions. Using accessibility models trained on cell types from specific tissues, we find that increasing model capacity to learn cell type-specific regulatory syntax-through single-task learning or high capacity multi-task models-can improve performance in cell type-specific accessible regions. We also observe that improving reference sequence predictions does not consistently improve variant effect predictions, indicating that novel strategies are needed to improve performance on variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a new perspective on the performance of genomic deep learning models, showing that performance varies across the genome and is particularly reduced in cell type-specific accessible regions.

Deep learning excels on large datasets, offering promise for real-world data. However, current models focus on single diseases, neglecting comorbidities prevalent in patients. Moreover, mortality is infrequent compared to illness, causing extreme class imbalance that impedes reliable prediction. We aim to develop a deep learning framework that accurately forecasts mortality risk from real-world data by addressing comorbidities and class imbalance.
METHODS: We integrated multi-task and cost-sensitive learning, developing an enhanced deep neural network architecture that extends multi-task learning to predict mortality risk across multiple chronic diseases. Each patient cohort with a chronic disease was assigned to a separate task, with shared lower-level parameters capturing inter-disease complexities through distinct top-level networks. Cost-sensitive functions were incorporated to ensure learning of positive class characteristics for each task and achieve accurate prediction of the risk of death from multiple chronic diseases.
RESULTS: Our study covers 15 prevalent chronic diseases and is experimented with real-world data from 482,145 patients (including 9,516 deaths) in Shenzhen, China. The proposed model is compared with six models including three machine learning models: logistic regression, XGBoost, and CatBoost, and three state-of-the-art deep learning models: 1D-CNN, TabNet, and Saint. The experimental results show that, compared with the other compared algorithms, MTL-CSDNN has better prediction results on the test set (ACC=0.99, REC=0.99, PRAUC=0.97, MCC=0.98, G-means = 0.98).
CONCLUSIONS: Our method provides valuable insights into leveraging real-world data for precise multi-disease mortality risk prediction, offering potential applications in optimizing chronic disease management, enhancing well-being, and reducing healthcare costs for the elderly population.",0.19602553394810185,computer vision,"logistic regression, CNN"

Herein, we develop and validate a deep-learning-based model entitled end-motif inspection via transformer (EMIT) for discriminating individuals with and without cancer by learning feature representations from cfDNA end-motifs. EMIT is a self-supervised learning approach that models rankings of cfDNA end-motifs. We include 4606 samples subjected to different types of cfDNA sequencing to develop EIMIT, and subsequently evaluate classification performance of linear projections of EMIT on six datasets and an additional inhouse testing set encopassing whole-genome, whole-genome bisulfite and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine sequencing. The linear projection of representations from EMIT achieved area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) values ranged from 0.895 (0.835-0.955) to 0.996 (0.994-0.997) across these six datasets, outperforming its baseline by significant margins. Additionally, we showed that linear projection of EMIT representations can achieve an AUROC of 0.962 (0.914-1.0) in identification of lung cancer on an independent testing set subjected to whole-exome sequencing.

Model evaluations commonly report performance genome-wide; however, cis regulatory elements (CREs), which play critical roles in gene regulation, make up only a small fraction of the genome. Furthermore, cell type specific CREs contain a large proportion of complex disease heritability.
RESULTS: We evaluate genomic deep learning models in chromatin accessibility regions with varying degrees of cell type specificity. We assess two modeling directions in the field: general purpose models trained across thousands of outputs (cell types and epigenetic marks), and models tailored to specific tissues and tasks. We find that the accuracy of genomic deep learning models, including two state-of-the-art general purpose models - Enformer and Sei - varies across the genome and is reduced in cell type specific accessible regions. Using accessibility models trained on cell types from specific tissues, we find that increasing model capacity to learn cell type specific regulatory syntax - through single-task learning or high capacity multi-task models - can improve performance in cell type specific accessible regions. We also observe that improving reference sequence predictions does not consistently improve variant effect predictions, indicating that novel strategies are needed to improve performance on variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a new perspective on the performance of genomic deep learning models, showing that performance varies across the genome and is particularly reduced in cell type specific accessible regions. We also identify strategies to maximize performance in cell type specific accessible regions.",0.15656845204122116,other,Unknown

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A fine-tuned, domain-specific, transformer-based clinical text deep learning model was used to interpret free-text nursing assessments in the electronic medical records of 235,789 adult presentations to the ED over a three-year period. The model classified presentations according to whether the patient had pain on arrival at the ED. Interrupted time series analysis was used to determine the incidence of pain in patients on arrival over time. We described the changes in the population characteristics and incidence of patients with pain on arrival occurring with the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: 55.16% (95%CI 54.95%-55.36%) of all patients presenting to this ED had pain on arrival. There were differences in demographics and arrival and departure patterns between patients with and without pain. The Covid-19 pandemic initially precipitated a decrease followed by a sharp, sustained rise in pain on arrival, with concurrent changes to the population arriving in pain and their treatment.
DISCUSSION: Applying a clinical text deep learning model has successfully identified the incidence of pain on arrival. It represents an automated, reproducible mechanism to identify pain from routinely collected medical records. The description of this population and their treatment forms the basis of intervention to improve care for patients with pain. The combination of the clinical text deep learning models and interrupted time series analysis has reported on the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on pain care in the ED, outlining a methodology to assess the impact of significant events or interventions on pain care in the ED.

Traditional methods of survival analysis are usually based on Cox Proportional Hazards model and assume proportional risk for all subjects. However, this assumption is rarely true for most diseases, as the underlying factors have complex, non-linear, and time-varying relationships. This concern is especially relevant for pregnancy, where the risk for pregnancy-related complications, such as preeclampsia, varies across gestation. Recently, deep learning survival models have shown promise in addressing the limitations of classical models, as the novel models allow for non-proportional risk handling, capturing nonlinear relationships, and navigating complex temporal dynamics.
METHODS: We present a methodology to model the temporal risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy and investigate the associated clinical risk factors. We utilized a retrospective dataset including 66,425 pregnant individuals who delivered in two tertiary care centers from 2015 to 2023. We modeled the preeclampsia risk by modifying DeepHit, a deep survival model, which leverages neural network architecture to capture time-varying relationships between covariates in pregnancy. We applied time series k-means clustering to DeepHit's normalized output and investigated interpretability using Shapley values.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that DeepHit can effectively handle high-dimensional data and evolving risk hazards over time with performance similar to the Cox Proportional Hazards model, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 for both models. The deep survival model outperformed traditional methodology by identifying time-varied risk trajectories for preeclampsia, providing insights for early and individualized intervention. K-means clustering resulted in patients delineating into low-risk, early-onset, and late-onset preeclampsia groups-notably, each of those has distinct risk factors.
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates a novel application of deep survival analysis in time-varying prediction of preeclampsia risk. Our results highlight the advantage of deep survival models compared to Cox Proportional Hazards models in providing personalized risk trajectory and demonstrating the potential of deep survival models to generate interpretable and meaningful clinical applications in medicine.",0.12788462407395138,other,"K-means, k-means"

While existing literature predominantly focuses on disease classification using clinical data, there exists a critical research gap concerning HCV genotyping based on genomic sequences. Accurate HCV genotyping is essential for patient management and treatment decisions. While the neural models excel at capturing complex patterns, they still face challenges, such as data scarcity, that exist a lot in computational genomics. To overcome this challenges, this paper introduces an advanced deep learning approach for HCV genotyping based on the graphical representation of nucleotide sequences that outperforms classical approaches. Notably, it is effective for both partial and complete HCV genomes and addresses challenges associated with imbalanced datasets. In this work, ten HCV genotypes: 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b, 4, 5, and 6 were used in the analysis. This study utilizes Chaos Game Representation for 2D mapping of genomic sequences, employing self-supervised learning using convolutional autoencoder for deep feature extraction, resulting in an outstanding performance for HCV genotyping compared to various machine learning and deep learning models. This baseline provides a benchmark against which the performance of the proposed approach and other models can be evaluated. The experimental results showcase a remarkable classification accuracy of over 99%, outperforming traditional deep learning models.

Traditional case-identification methods using claims data can be time-intensive and may miss important subgroups. We hypothesized that a deep learning model analyzing electronic health records (EHR) can more accurately identify AAV cases.
METHODS: We examined the Mass General Brigham (MGB) repository of clinical documentation from 12/1/1979 to 5/11/2021, using expert-curated keywords and ICD codes to identify a large cohort of potential AAV cases. Three labeled datasets (I, II, III) were created, each containing note sections. We trained and evaluated a range of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for note-level classification, using metrics like positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, F-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and area under the precision and recall curve (AUPRC). The deep learning model was further evaluated for its ability to classify AAV cases at the patient-level, compared with rule-based algorithms in 2,000 randomly chosen samples.
RESULTS: Datasets I, II, and III comprised 6,000, 3,008, and 7,500 note sections, respectively. Deep learning achieved the highest AUROC in all three datasets, with scores of 0.983, 0.991, and 0.991.

Yet, these models face limitations due to overfitting and the potential overestimation of effect sizes in correlated variants. To surmount these obstacles, we devised the Stacked Neural Network Polygenic Risk Score (SNPRS). This novel approach synthesises outputs from multiple neural network models, each calibrated using genetic variants chosen based on diverse p-value thresholds. By doing so, SNPRS captures a broader array of genetic variants, enabling a more nuanced interpretation of the combined effects of these variants. We assessed the efficacy of SNPRS using the UK Biobank data, focusing on the genetic risks associated with breast and prostate cancers, as well as quantitative traits like height and BMI. We also extended our analysis to the Korea Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) dataset. Impressively, our results indicate that SNPRS surpasses traditional PRS models and an isolated deep neural network in terms of accuracy, highlighting its promise in refining the efficacy and relevance of PRS in genetic studies.",0.13564533259366945,other,Unknown

However, the current deep learning models for in-hospital mortality prediction lack interpretability.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish an explainable deep learning model to provide individualized in-hospital mortality prediction and risk factor assessment for patients with AMI.
METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, we used data for consecutive patients hospitalized with AMI from the Chongqing University Central Hospital between July 2016 and December 2022 and the Electronic Intensive Care Unit Collaborative Research Database. These patients were randomly divided into training (7668/10,955, 70%) and internal test (3287/10,955, 30%) data sets. In addition, data of patients with AMI from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database were used for external validation. Deep learning models were used to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI, and they were compared with linear and tree-based models. The Shapley Additive Explanations method was used to explain the model with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in both the internal test and external validation data sets to quantify and visualize the features that drive predictions.
RESULTS: A total of 10,955 patients with AMI who were admitted to Chongqing University Central Hospital or included in the Electronic Intensive Care Unit Collaborative Research Database were randomly divided into a training data set of 7668 (70%) patients and an internal test data set of 3287 (30%) patients. A total of 9355 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database were included for independent external validation. In-hospital mortality occurred in 8.74% (670/7668), 8.73% (287/3287), and 9.12% (853/9355) of the patients in the training, internal test, and external validation cohorts, respectively. The Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer model performed best in both the internal test data set and the external validation data set among the 9 prediction models, with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.84-0.88) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.84-0.87), respectively. Older age, high heart rate, and low body temperature were the 3 most important predictors of increased mortality, according to the explanations of the Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer model.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to design a multimodal deep learning approach to improve the evaluation precision of hospital outcomes for heart failure (HF) using admission clinical notes and easily collected tabular data.
METHODS: Data for the development and validation of the multimodal model were retrospectively derived from 3 open-access US databases, including the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III v1.4 (MIMIC-III) and MIMIC-IV v1.0, collected from a teaching hospital from 2001 to 2019, and the eICU Collaborative Research Database v1.2, collected from 208 hospitals from 2014 to 2015. The study cohorts consisted of all patients with critical HF. The clinical notes, including chief complaint, history of present illness, physical examination, medical history, and admission medication, as well as clinical variables recorded in electronic health records, were analyzed. We developed a deep learning mortality prediction model for in-hospital patients, which underwent complete internal, prospective, and external evaluation.

RESULTS: The study included 9989 (16.4%) patients in the development set, 2497 (14.1%) patients in the internal validation set, 1896 (18.3%) in the prospective validation set, and 7432 (15%) patients in the external validation set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the models was 0.838 (95% CI 0.827-0.851), 0.849 (95% CI 0.841-0.856), and 0.767 (95% CI 0.762-0.772), for the internal, prospective, and external validation sets, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the multimodal model outperformed that of the unimodal models in all test sets, and tabular data contributed to higher discrimination.

Recently suggested solutions involve machine learning to identify surgical site infections directly from the medical record. Deep learning is a form of machine learning that has historically performed better than traditional methods while being harder to interpret. We propose a deep learning model, a long short-term memory network, for the identification of surgical site infection from the medical record with an attention layer for explainability.
METHODS: We retrieved structured data and clinical notes from the University of Utah Health System's electronic health care record for operative events randomly selected for manual chart review from January 2016 to June 2021. Surgical site infection occurring within 30 days of surgery was determined according to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program definition. We trained the long short-term memory model along with traditional machine learning models for comparison. We calculated several performance metrics from a holdout test set and performed additional analyses to understand the performance of the long short-term memory, including an explainability analysis.
RESULTS: Surgical site infection was present in 4.7% of the total 9,185 operative events. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and sensitivity of the long short-term memory was higher (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.954, sensitivity: 0.920) compared to the top traditional model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.937, sensitivity: 0.736).

Epub 2024 Mar 22.,Li Z,J Biomed Inform,2024,2024/03/23,,,10.1016/j.jbi.2024.104626,"OBJECTIVE: The accuracy of deep learning models for many disease prediction problems is affected by time-varying covariates, rare incidence, covariate imbalance and delayed diagnosis when using structured electronic health records data. The situation is further exasperated when predicting the risk of one disease on condition of another disease, such as the hepatocellular carcinoma risk among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease due to slow, chronic progression, the scarce of data with both disease conditions and the sex bias of the diseases. The goal of this study is to investigate the extent to which the aforementioned issues influence deep learning performance, and then devised strategies to tackle these challenges. These strategies were applied to improve hepatocellular carcinoma risk prediction among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
METHODS: We evaluated two representative deep learning models in the task of predicting the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma in a cohort of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 220,838) from a national EHR database. The disease prediction task was carefully formulated as a classification problem while taking censorship and the length of follow-up into consideration.
RESULTS: We developed a novel backward masking scheme to deal with the issue of delayed diagnosis which is very common in EHR data analysis and evaluate how the length of longitudinal information after the index date affects disease prediction. We observed that modeling time-varying covariates improved the performance of the algorithms and transfer learning mitigated reduced performance caused by the lack of data. In addition, covariate imbalance, such as sex bias in data impaired performance. Deep learning models trained on one sex and evaluated in the other sex showed reduced performance, indicating the importance of assessing covariate imbalance while preparing data for model training.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively included 556 SCLC patients from three medical centers. The training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts comprised 309, 133, and 114 patients, respectively. The OS signature was built using a unified fully connected neural network. A deep learning model was developed based on the OS signature. Clinical and combined models were developed and compared with a deep learning model. Additionally, the benefits of PCI were evaluated after stratification using an OS signature.
RESULTS: Within the internal and external validation cohorts, the deep learning model (concordance index [C-index] 0.745, 0.733) was far superior to the clinical model (C-index: 0.635, 0.630) in predicting OS, but slightly worse than the combined model (C-index: 0.771, 0.770). Additionally, the deep learning model had excellent calibration, clinical usefulness, and improved accuracy in classifying survival outcomes. Remarkably, patients at high risk had a survival benefit from PCI in both the limited and extensive stages (all P < 0.05), whereas no significant association was observed in patients at low risk.
CONCLUSIONS: The CT-based deep learning model exhibited promising performance in predicting the OS of SCLC patients. The OS signature may aid in individualized treatment planning to select patients who may benefit from PCI.",0.21960484402431696,other,Unknown

We developed a multitask deep learning model to predict MVI and RFS using preoperative MRI scans.
METHODS: Utilising a retrospective dataset of 725 HCC patients from seven institutions, we developed and validated a multitask deep learning model focused on predicting MVI and RFS. The model employs a transformer architecture to extract critical features from preoperative MRI scans. It was trained on a set of 234 patients and internally validated on a set of 58 patients. External validation was performed using three independent sets (n = 212, 111, 110).
RESULTS: The multitask deep learning model yielded high MVI prediction accuracy, with AUC values of 0.918 for the training set and 0.800 for the internal test set. In external test sets, AUC values were 0.837, 0.815 and 0.800. Radiologists' sensitivity and inter-rater agreement for MVI prediction improved significantly when integrated with the model. For RFS, the model achieved C-index values of 0.763 in the training set and ranged between 0.628 and 0.728 in external test sets. Notably, PA-TACE improved RFS only in patients predicted to have high MVI risk and low survival scores (p < .001).

Accurate risk stratification allows timely implantation of intracardiac defibrillators and is currently performed with a multimodality prediction model.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether an explainable deep learning-based approach allows risk prediction with only electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
METHODS: A total of 679 PLN p.(Arg14del) carriers without MVA at baseline were identified. A deep learning-based variational auto-encoder, trained on 1.1 million ECGs, was used to convert the 12-lead baseline ECG into its FactorECG, a compressed version of the ECG that summarizes it into 32 explainable factors. Prediction models were developed by Cox regression.
RESULTS: The deep learning-based ECG-only approach was able to predict MVA with a C statistic of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.83), comparable to the current prediction model (C statistic, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.79-0.88]; P = .054) and outperforming a model based on conventional ECG parameters (low-voltage ECG and negative T waves; C statistic, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.58-0.73]; P < .001). Clinical simulations showed that a 2-step approach, with ECG-only screening followed by a full workup, resulted in 60% less additional diagnostics while outperforming the multimodal prediction model in all patients. A visualization tool was created to provide interactive visualizations (https://pln.ecgx.ai).

There has been progress in reducing hospitalizations and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2. However, challenges stem from the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which exhibit high transmission rates, increased disease severity, and the ability to evade humoral immunity. Epitope-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition is key in determining the T-cell immunogenicity for SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Although several data-driven methods for predicting epitope-specific TCR recognition have been proposed, they remain challenging due to the enormous diversity of TCRs and the lack of available training data. Self-supervised transfer learning has recently been proven useful for extracting information from unlabeled protein sequences, increasing the predictive performance of fine-tuned models, and using a relatively small amount of training data. This study presents a deep-learning model generated by fine-tuning pre-trained protein embeddings from a large corpus of protein sequences. The fine-tuned model showed markedly high predictive performance and outperformed the recent Gaussian process-based prediction model.

The medical research community has widely used computer analysis of medical data during the pandemic, specifically deep learning models. Deploying models on devices with constrained resources is a significant challenge due to the increased storage demands associated with larger deep learning models. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel compression strategy that compresses deep features with a compression ratio of 10 to 90% to accurately classify the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 computed tomography scans. Additionally, we extensively validated the compression using various available deep learning methods to extract the most suitable features from different models. Finally, the suggested DeepCSFusion model compresses the extracted features and applies fusion to achieve the highest classification accuracy with fewer features. The proposed DeepCSFusion model was validated on the publicly available dataset ""SARS-CoV-2 CT"" scans composed of 1252 CT.

Various factors can impact the control of an epidemic, including social interventions, adherence to health protocols, mask-wearing, and vaccination. This article presents the development of an innovative hybrid model, known as the Combined Dynamic-Learning Model, that integrates classical recurrent dynamic models with four different learning methods. The model is composed of two approaches: The first approach introduces a traditional dynamic model that focuses on analyzing the impact of vaccination on the occurrence of an epidemic, and the second approach employs various learning methods to forecast the potential outcomes of an epidemic. Furthermore, our numerical results offer an interesting comparison between the traditional approach and modern learning techniques. Our classic dynamic model is a compartmental model that aims to analyze and forecast the diffusion of epidemics. The model we propose has a recurrent structure with piecewise constant parameters and includes compartments for susceptible, exposed, vaccinated, infected, and recovered individuals. This model can accurately mirror the dynamics of infectious diseases, which enables us to evaluate the impact of restrictive measures on the spread of diseases. We conduct a comprehensive dynamic analysis of our model. Additionally, we suggest an optimal numerical design to determine the parameters of the system. Also, we use regression tree learning, bidirectional long short-term memory, gated recurrent unit, and a combined deep learning method for training and evaluation of an epidemic. In the final section of our paper, we apply these methods to recently published data on COVID-19 in Austria, Brazil, and China from 26 February 2021 to 4 August 2021, which is when vaccination efforts began. To evaluate the numerical results, we utilized various metrics such as RMSE and R-squared. Our findings suggest that the dynamic model is ideal for long-term analysis, data fitting, and identifying parameters that impact epidemics. However, it is not as effective as the supervised learning method for making long-term forecasts. On the other hand, supervised learning techniques, compared to dynamic models, are more effective for predicting the spread of diseases, but not for analyzing the behavior of epidemics.",0.13669235637339838,other,Unknown

Neuroimaging features have demonstrated the capacity to distinguish cognitive decline changes stemming from typical brain aging and AD between different chronological points.
OBJECTIVE: To disentangle the normal aging effect from the AD-related accelerated cognitive decline and unravel its genetic components using a neuroimaging-based deep learning approach.
METHODS: We developed a deep-learning framework based on a dual-loss Siamese ResNet network to extract fine-grained information from the longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We then conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and post-GWAS analyses to reveal the genetic basis of AD-related accelerated cognitive decline.
RESULTS: We used our model to process data from 1,313 individuals, training it on 414 cognitively normal people and predicting cognitive assessment for all participants. In our analysis of accelerated cognitive decline GWAS, we identified two genome-wide significant loci: APOE locus (chromosome 19 p13.32) and rs144614292 (chromosome 11 p15.1). Variant rs144614292 (G > T) has not been reported in previous AD GWA studies. It is within the intronic region of NELL1, which is expressed in neurons and plays a role in controlling cell growth and differentiation. The cell-type-specific enrichment analysis and functional enrichment of GWAS signals highlighted the microglia and immune-response pathways.

A common application areas is activity recognition, where deep-learning methods still suffer from limitations such as sensitivity to signal quality, sensor characteristic variations, and variability between subjects. To mitigate these issues, robust features obtained by topological data analysis (TDA) have been suggested as a potential solution. However, there are two significant obstacles to using topological features in deep learning: (1) large computational load to extract topological features using TDA, and (2) different signal representations obtained from deep learning and TDA which makes fusion difficult. In this paper, to enable integration of the strengths of topological methods in deep-learning for time-series data, we propose to use two teacher networks - one trained on the raw time-series data, and another trained on persistence images generated by TDA methods. These two teachers are jointly used to distill a single student model, which utilizes only the raw time-series data at test-time. This approach addresses both issues. The use of KD with multiple teachers utilizes complementary information, and results in a compact model with strong supervisory features and an integrated richer representation. To assimilate desirable information from different modalities, we design new constraints, including orthogonality imposed on feature correlation maps for improving feature expressiveness and allowing the student to easily learn from the teacher. Also, we apply an annealing strategy in KD for fast saturation and better accommodation from different features, while the knowledge gap between the teachers and student is reduced. Finally, a robust student model is distilled, which can at test-time uses only the time-series data as an input, while implicitly preserving topological features. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on wearable sensor data.

Precisely predicting these comorbidities is crucial for providing personalized care and making well-informed clinical decisions. However, there is a shortage of research investigating the identification of risk factors associated with ACS comorbidities and accurately predicting their likelihood of occurrence beyond heart failure. In this study, an approach called Combined-task Deep Network based on LassoNet feature selection (CDNL) is presented for predicting ACS comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and heart failure. In order to identify crucial biomarkers associated with ACS comorbidities, the proposed framework first incorporates LassoNet, which extends Lasso regression to the deep network by adding a skip (residual) layer. Additionally, a correlation score calculation method across tasks is introduced based on measuring the overlap of identified biomarkers and their assigned importance. This method enables the development of an optimal combined-task prediction model for each ACS comorbidity, addressing the challenge of limited representations in traditional multi-task learning. Our evaluation, conducted through a meticulous cross-sectional study at a tertiary hospital in China, involved a dataset of 2941 samples with 42 clinical features.

Here, we developed a deep learning pipeline for opportunistic screening of impaired glucose metabolism using routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver and tested its prognostic value in a general population setting.
METHODS: In this retrospective study a fully automatic deep learning pipeline was developed to quantify liver shape features on routine MR imaging using data from a prospective population study. Subsequently, the association between liver shape features and impaired glucose metabolism was investigated in individuals with prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and healthy controls without prior cardiovascular diseases. K-medoids clustering (3 clusters) with a dissimilarity matrix based on Euclidean distance and ordinal regression was used to assess the association between liver shape features and glycaemic status.
RESULTS: The deep learning pipeline showed a high performance for liver shape analysis with a mean Dice score of 97.0±0.01. Out of 339 included individuals (mean age 56.3±9.1 years; males 58.1%), 79 (23.3%) and 46 (13.6%) were classified as having prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Individuals in the high risk cluster using all liver shape features (n = 14) had a 2.4 fold increased risk of impaired glucose metabolism after adjustment for cardiometabolic risk factors (age, sex, BMI, total cholesterol, alcohol consumption, hypertension, smoking and hepatic steatosis; OR 2.44 [95% CI 1.12-5.38]; p = 0.03).

Here, we investigated the utility of deep learning techniques, specifically random forests combined with transfer learning, in enhancing serum glycome's discriminative power for cancer diagnosis (including ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, and esophageal cancer). We started with ovarian cancer and demonstrated that transfer learning can achieve superior performance in data-disadvantaged cohorts (AUROC >0.9), outperforming the approach of PLS-DA. We identified a serum glycan-biomarker panel including 18 serum N-glycans and 4 glycan derived traits, most of which were featured with sialylation. Furthermore, we validated advantage of the transfer learning scheme across other cancer groups. These findings highlighted the superiority of transfer learning in improving the performance of glycans-based cancer diagnosis model and identifying cancer biomarkers, providing a new high-fidelity cancer diagnosis venue.",0.11922856571680407,other,Unknown

Likelihood-based methods fit models to phylogenies to draw inferences about the phylodynamics and history of viral transmission. However, these methods are often computationally expensive, which limits the complexity and realism of phylodynamic models and makes them ill-suited for informing policy decisions in real-time during rapidly developing outbreaks. Likelihood-free methods using deep learning are pushing the boundaries of inference beyond these constraints. In this paper, we extend, compare, and contrast a recently developed deep learning method for likelihood-free inference from trees. We trained multiple deep neural networks using phylogenies from simulated outbreaks that spread among 5 locations and found they achieve close to the same levels of accuracy as Bayesian inference under the true simulation model. We compared robustness to model misspecification of a trained neural network to that of a Bayesian method. We found that both models had comparable performance, converging on similar biases. We also implemented a method of uncertainty quantification called conformalized quantile regression that we demonstrate has similar patterns of sensitivity to model misspecification as Bayesian highest posterior density (HPD) and greatly overlap with HPDs, but have lower precision (more conservative). Finally, we trained and tested a neural network against phylogeographic data from a recent study of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in Europe and obtained similar estimates of region-specific epidemiological parameters and the location of the common ancestor in Europe. Along with being as accurate and robust as likelihood-based methods, our trained neural networks are on average over 3 orders of magnitude faster after training. Our results support the notion that neural networks can be trained with simulated data to accurately mimic the good and bad statistical properties of the likelihood functions of generative phylogenetic models.",0.14558621044410025,other,Unknown

It affected 1.2 million children around the world in the same year. As it is an infectious bacterial disease, the early diagnosis of TB prevents further transmission and increases the survival rate of the affected person. One of the standard diagnosis methods is the sputum culture test. Diagnosing and rapid sputum test results usually take one to eight weeks in 24 h. Using posterior-anterior chest radiographs (CXR) facilitates a rapid and more cost-effective early diagnosis of tuberculosis. Due to intraclass variations and interclass similarities in the images, TB prognosis from CXR is difficult. We proposed an early TB diagnosis system (tbXpert) based on deep learning methods. Deep Fused Linear Triangulation (FLT) is considered for CXR images to reconcile intraclass variation and interclass similarities. To improve the robustness of the prognosis approach, deep information must be obtained from the minimal radiation and uneven quality CXR images. The advanced FLT method accurately visualizes the infected region in the CXR without segmentation. Deep fused images are trained by the Deep learning network (DLN) with residual connections. The largest standard database, comprised of 3500 TB CXR images and 3500 normal CXR images, is utilized for training and validating the recommended model. Specificity, sensitivity, Accuracy, and AUC are estimated to determine the performance of the proposed systems. The proposed system demonstrates a maximum testing accuracy of 99.2%, a sensitivity of 98.9%, a specificity of 99.6%, a precision of 99.6%, and an AUC of 99.4%, all of which are pretty high when compared to current state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for the prognosis of tuberculosis. To lessen the radiologist's time, effort, and reliance on the level of competence of the specialist, the suggested system named tbXpert can be deployed as a computer-aided diagnosis technique for tuberculosis.",0.1547754208189495,computer vision,Unknown

Histopathological tissue slides of colorectal cancer specimens contain rich prognostically relevant information. However, existing studies do not have multicentre external validation with real-world sample processing protocols, and algorithms are not yet widely used in clinical routine.
METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre study, we collected tissue samples from four groups of patients with resected colorectal cancer from Australia, Germany, and the USA. We developed and externally validated a deep learning-based prognostic-stratification system for automatic prediction of overall and cancer-specific survival in patients with resected colorectal cancer. We used the model-predicted risk scores to stratify patients into different risk groups and compared survival outcomes between these groups. Additionally, we evaluated the prognostic value of these risk groups after adjusting for established prognostic variables.
FINDINGS: We trained and validated our model on a total of 4428 patients. We found that patients could be divided into high-risk and low-risk groups on the basis of the deep learning-based risk score. On the internal test set, the group with a high-risk score had a worse prognosis than the group with a low-risk score, as reflected by a hazard ratio (HR) of 4·50 (95% CI 3·33-6·09) for overall survival and 8·35 (5·06-13·78) for disease-specific survival (DSS). We found consistent performance across three large external test sets. In a test set of 1395 patients, the high-risk group had a lower DSS than the low-risk group, with an HR of 3·08 (2·44-3·89). In two additional test sets, the HRs for DSS were 2·23 (1·23-4·04) and 3·07 (1·78-5·3). We showed that the prognostic value of the deep learning-based risk score is independent of established clinical risk factors.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that attention-based self-supervised deep learning can robustly offer a prognosis on clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer, generalising across different populations and serving as a potentially new prognostic tool in clinical decision making for colorectal cancer management. We release all source codes and trained models under an open-source licence, allowing other researchers to reuse and build upon our work.

METHODS: To develop a deep learning-based prognostic model using chest radiographs (DLPM), the patients diagnosed with IPF during 2011-2021 were retrospectively collected and were divided into training (n = 1007), validation (n = 117), and internal test (n = 187) datasets. Up to 10 consecutive radiographs were included for each patient. For external testing, three cohorts from independent institutions were collected (n = 152, 141, and 207). The discrimination performance of DLPM was evaluated using areas under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves (TD-AUCs) for 3-year survival and compared with that of forced vital capacity (FVC). Multivariable Cox regression was performed to investigate whether the DLPM was an independent prognostic factor from FVC. We devised a modified gender-age-physiology (GAP) index (GAP-CR), by replacing D<sub>LCO</sub> with DLPM.
RESULTS: DLPM showed similar-to-higher performance at predicting 3-year survival than FVC in three external test cohorts (TD-AUC: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.76-0.90] vs. 0.68 [0.59-0.77], p < 0.001; 0.76 [0.68-0.85] vs. 0.70 [0.60-0.80], p = 0.21; 0.79 [0.72-0.86] vs. 0.76 [0.69-0.83], p = 0.41). DLPM worked as an independent prognostic factor from FVC in all three cohorts (ps < 0.001). The GAP-CR index showed a higher 3-year TD-AUC than the original GAP index in two of the three external test cohorts (TD-AUC: 0.85 [0.80-0.91] vs. 0.79 [0.72-0.86], p = 0.02; 0.72 [0.64-0.80] vs. 0.69 [0.61-0.78], p = 0.56; 0.76 [0.69-0.83] vs. 0.68 [0.60-0.76], p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning model successfully predicted survival in patients with IPF from chest radiographs, comparable to and independent of FVC.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Deep learning-based prognostication from chest radiographs offers comparable-to-higher prognostic performance than forced vital capacity.
KEY POINTS: • A deep learning-based prognostic model for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was developed using 6063 radiographs. • The prognostic performance of the model was comparable-to-higher than forced vital capacity, and was independent from FVC in all three external test cohorts. • A modified gender-age-physiology index replacing diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide with the deep learning model showed higher performance than the original index in two external test cohorts.",0.13888394656442765,other,Unknown

Thus, the ability of classifiers to make reliable decisions is of paramount importance. Deep neural networks (DNNs) represent the state-of-the-art models to address real-world classification. Although the strength of activation in DNNs is often correlated with the network's confidence, in-depth analyses are needed to establish whether they are well calibrated.
METHOD: In this paper, we demonstrate the use of DNN-based classification tools to benefit cancer registries by automating information extraction of disease at diagnosis and at surgery from electronic text pathology reports from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-based cancer registries. In particular, we introduce multiple methods for selective classification to achieve a target level of accuracy on multiple classification tasks while minimizing the rejection amount-that is, the number of electronic pathology reports for which the model's predictions are unreliable. We evaluate the proposed methods by comparing our approach with the current in-house deep learning-based abstaining classifier.
RESULTS: Overall, all the proposed selective classification methods effectively allow for achieving the targeted level of accuracy or higher in a trade-off analysis aimed to minimize the rejection rate. On in-distribution validation and holdout test data, with all the proposed methods, we achieve on all tasks the required target level of accuracy with a lower rejection rate than the deep abstaining classifier (DAC). Interpreting the results for the out-of-distribution test data is more complex; nevertheless, in this case as well, the rejection rate from the best among the proposed methods achieving 97% accuracy or higher is lower than the rejection rate based on the DAC.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that although both approaches can flag those samples that should be manually reviewed and labeled by human annotators, the newly proposed methods retain a larger fraction and do so without retraining-thus offering a reduced computational cost compared with the in-house deep learning-based abstaining classifier.",0.13482963415001498,other,Unknown

We sought to identify Electronic Health Record (EHR) features of severe asthma and COPD exacerbations and evaluate the performance of four machine learning (ML) and one deep learning (DL) model in predicting readmissions using EHR data.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Observational study between September 30, 2012, and December 31, 2017, of patients hospitalized with asthma and COPD exacerbations.
RESULTS: This study included 5,794 patients, 1,893 with asthma and 3,901 with COPD. Patients with asthma were predominantly female (n = 1288 [68%]), 35% were Black (n = 669), and 25% (n = 479) were Hispanic. Black (44 vs. 33%, p = 0.01) and Hispanic patients (30 vs. 24%, p = 0.02) were more likely to be readmitted for asthma.

This study proposes an integrated model using clinical features, radiomics, and deep learning based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images for survival prediction in patients with GBC after surgical resection.
METHODS: A total of 167 patients with GBC who underwent surgical resection at two medical institutions were retrospectively enrolled. After obtaining the pre-treatment CT images, the tumor lesions were manually segmented, and handcrafted radiomics features were extracted. A clinical prognostic signature and radiomics signature were built using machine learning algorithms based on the optimal clinical features or handcrafted radiomics features, respectively. Subsequently, a DenseNet121 model was employed for transfer learning on the radiomics image data and as the basis for the deep learning signature. Finally, we used logistic regression on the three signatures to obtain the unified multimodal model for comprehensive interpretation and analysis.
RESULTS: The integrated model performed better than the other models, exhibiting the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.870 in the test set, and the highest concordance index (C-index) of 0.736 in predicting patient survival rates. A Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients in high-risk group had a lower survival probability compared to those in low-risk group (log-rank p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The nomogram is useful for predicting the survival of patients with GBC after surgical resection, helping in the identification of high-risk patients with poor prognosis and ultimately facilitating individualized management of patients with GBC.",0.10997891943802732,computer vision,logistic regression

Pathology determines the causes behind the disease and identifies its development mechanism and functional consequences. Each disease has different identification methods, including X-ray scans for pneumonia, covid-19, and lung cancer, whereas biopsy and CT-scan can identify the presence of skin cancer and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Early disease detection leads to effective treatment and avoids abiding complications. Deep learning has provided a vast number of applications in medical sectors resulting in accurate and reliable early disease predictions. These models are utilized in the healthcare industry to provide supplementary assistance to doctors in identifying the presence of diseases. Majorly, these models are trained through secondary data sources since healthcare institutions refrain from sharing patients' private data to ensure confidentiality, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning models due to the requirement of extensive datasets for training to achieve optimal results. Federated learning deals with the data in such a way that it doesn't exploit the privacy of a patient's data. In this work, a wide variety of disease detection models trained through federated learning have been rigorously reviewed. This meta-analysis provides an in-depth review of the federated learning architectures, federated learning types, hyperparameters, dataset utilization details, aggregation techniques, performance measures, and augmentation methods applied in the existing models during the development phase. The review also highlights various open challenges associated with the disease detection models trained through federated learning for future research.",0.17409689734533637,other,Unknown

Due to the limited number of experimentally validated immunogenic neoepitopes as well as the complexity of neoantigens in eliciting T cell response, the accuracy of neoepitope immunogenicity prediction methods requires persistent efforts for improvement. We present a deep learning framework for neoepitope immunogenicity prediction - SIGANEO by integrating GAN-like network with similarity network to address issues of missing values and limited data concerning neoantigen prediction. This framework exhibits superior performance over competing machine-learning-based neoantigen prediction algorithms over an independent test dataset from TESLA consortium. Particularly for the clinical setting of neoantigen vaccine where only the top 10 and 20 predictions are selected for vaccine production, SIGANEO achieves significantly better accuracy for predicting experimentally validated neoepitopes.

Current machine learning models utilize pre- and post-op data, excluding intraoperative information in surgical notes. Current models also usually predict binary outcomes even when surgeries have multiple outcomes that require different postoperative management. This study addresses these gaps by incorporating intraoperative information into multimodal models for multiclass glaucoma surgery outcome prediction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed and evaluated multimodal deep learning models for multiclass glaucoma trabeculectomy surgery outcomes using both structured EHR data and free-text operative notes. We compare those to baseline models that use structured EHR data exclusively, or neural network models that leverage only operative notes.
RESULTS: The multimodal neural network had the highest performance with a macro AUROC of 0.750 and F1 score of 0.583. It outperformed the baseline machine learning model with structured EHR data alone (macro AUROC of 0.712 and F1 score of 0.486). Additionally, the multimodal model achieved the highest recall (0.692) for hypotony surgical failure, while the surgical success group had the highest precision (0.884) and F1 score (0.775).
DISCUSSION: This study shows that operative notes are an important source of predictive information. The multimodal predictive model combining perioperative notes and structured pre- and post-op EHR data outperformed other models. Multiclass surgical outcome prediction can provide valuable insights for clinical decision-making.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the potential of deep learning models to enhance clinical decision-making for postoperative management. They can be applied to other specialties to improve surgical outcome predictions.",0.10064214743153656,other,Unknown

Stochastic models are deemed more appropriate than deterministic models accounting in terms of essential and practical information about a system. The objective of the current investigation is to address the issue above through the development of a novel deep neural network referred to as a stochastic epidemiology-informed neural network. This network learns knowledge about the parameters and dynamics of a stochastic epidemic vaccine model. Our analysis centers on examining the nonlinear incidence rate of the model from the perspective of the combined effects of vaccination and stochasticity. Based on empirical evidence, stochastic models offer a more comprehensive understanding than deterministic models, mainly when we use error metrics. The findings of our study indicate that a decrease in randomness and an increase in vaccination rates are associated with a better prediction of nonlinear incidence rates. Adopting a nonlinear incidence rate enables a more comprehensive representation of the complexities of transmitting diseases. The computational analysis of the proposed method, focusing on sensitivity analysis and overfitting analysis, shows that the proposed method is efficient.

Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly employed in monitoring, screening, and identifying different cardiovascular clinical conditions. It was proposed that ML may be a useful tool for predicting POAF after cardiac surgery. An electronic database search was conducted on Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify primary studies that investigated the role of ML in predicting POAF after cardiac surgery. A total of 5,955 citations were subjected to title and abstract screening, and ultimately 5 studies were included. The reported incidence of POAF ranged from 21.5% to 37.1%. The studied ML models included: deep learning, decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, gradient boosting decision tree, gradient-boosted machine, K-nearest neighbors, neural network, and random forest models. The sensitivity of the reported ML models ranged from 0.22 to 0.91, the specificity from 0.64 to 0.84, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.67 to 0.94. Age, gender, left atrial diameter, glomerular filtration rate, and duration of mechanical ventilation were significant clinical risk factors for POAF. Limited evidence suggest that machine learning models may play a role in predicting atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery because of their ability to detect different patterns of correlations and the incorporation of several demographic and clinical variables.

OBJECTIVE: Using TGD identification as a case study, this research uses NLP and deep learning to build an accurate patient gender identity predictive model, aiming to tackle the challenges of identifying relevant patient-level information from EHR data and reducing annotation work.
METHODS: This study included adult patients in a large healthcare system in Boston, MA, between 4/1/2017 to 4/1/2022. To identify relevant information from massive clinical notes, we compiled a list of gender-related keywords through expert curation, literature review, and expansion via a fine-tuned BioWordVec model. This keyword list was used to pre-screen potential TGD individuals and create two datasets for model training, testing, and validation. Dataset I was a balanced dataset that contained clinician-confirmed TGD patients and cases without keywords. Dataset II contained cases with keywords. The performance of the deep learning model was compared to traditional machine learning and rule-based algorithms.
RESULTS: The final keyword list consists of 109 keywords, of which 58 (53.2%) were expanded by the BioWordVec model. Dataset I contained 3,150 patients (50% TGD) while Dataset II contained 200 patients (90% TGD).

It triages screening episodes as gradable with no DR versus manual grading required. The study aim was to develop a deep learning-based autograder using images and gradings from DES and to compare its performance with that of iGradingM.
METHODS: Retinal images, quality assurance (QA) data and routine DR grades were obtained from national datasets in 179 944 patients for years 2006-2016. QA grades were available for 744 images. We developed a deep learning-based algorithm to detect whether either eye contained ungradable images or any DR. The sensitivity and specificity were evaluated against consensus QA grades and routine grades.
RESULTS: Images used in QA which were ungradable or with DR were detected by deep learning with better specificity compared with manual graders (p<0.001) and with iGradingM (p<0.001) at the same sensitivities. Any DR according to the DES final grade was detected with 89.19% (270 392/303 154) sensitivity and 77.41% (500 945/647 158) specificity.

This study aimed to construct a risk subtype typing model for SKCM.
METHODS: The study proposes a deep learning framework combining early fusion feature autoencoder (AE) and late fusion feature AE for risk subtype prediction of SKCM. The deep learning framework integrates mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation data of SKCM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and clusters the screened multi-omics features associated with survival prognosis to identify risk subtypes. Differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis were performed between risk subtypes, while SVM classifiers were constructed between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression screening and risk subtype labels inferred from multi-omics data, and the predictive robustness of risk subtypes inferred from the risk subtype classification prediction model was validated using two independent datasets.
RESULTS: The deep learning framework that combined early fusion feature AE with late fusion feature AE distinguished the two best risk subtypes compared to the multi-omics integration approach with single strategy AE or PCA. A promising C-index (C-index = 0.748) and a significant difference in survival (log-rank P value = 4.61 × 10-9) were found between the identified risk subtypes. The DEGs with the top significance values together with differentially expressed miRNAs provided the biological interpretation of risk subtypes on SKCM. Finally, the framework was applied to predict risk subtypes in two independent test datasets of SKCM patients, all of which showed good predictive power (C-index &gt; 0.680) and significant survival differences (log-rank P value &lt; 0.01).

Compartmental models produce a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are renowned for simulating the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. However, the parameters in compartmental models are often unknown, and they can even change over time in the real world, making them difficult to determine. This study proposes an advanced artificial intelligence approach based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to estimate time-varying parameters from given data for the compartmental model. Our proposed PINNs method captures the complex dynamics of COVID-19 by integrating a modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Death (SEIRD) compartmental model with deep neural networks. Specifically, we modelled the system of ODEs as one network and the time-varying parameters as another network to address significant unknown parameters and limited data. Such structure of the PINNs method is in line with the prior epidemiological correlations and comprises the mismatch between available data and network output and the residual of ODEs. The experimental findings on real-world reported data data have demonstrated that our method robustly and accurately learns the dynamics and forecasts future states.

Here, we present a biology-guided deep learning approach that enables simultaneous prediction of the tumor immune and stromal microenvironment status as well as treatment outcomes from medical images. We validate the model for predicting prognosis of gastric cancer and the benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in a multi-center international study.

Deep learning models built on these databases have been developed and applied to tackle the cancer drug-response prediction task. Their prediction has been demonstrated to significantly outperform traditional machine learning methods. However, due to the ""black box"" characteristic, biologically faithful explanations are hardly derived from these deep learning models. Interpretable deep learning models that rely on visible neural networks (VNNs) have been proposed to provide biological justification for the predicted outcomes. However, their performance does not meet the expectation to be applied in clinical practice. Methods: In this paper, we develop an XMR model, an eXplainable Multimodal neural network for drug Response prediction. XMR is a new compact multimodal neural network consisting of two sub-networks: a visible neural network for learning genomic features and a graph neural network (GNN) for learning drugs' structural features. Both sub-networks are integrated into a multimodal fusion layer to model the drug response for the given gene mutations and the drug's molecular structures. Furthermore, a pruning approach is applied to provide better interpretations of the XMR model. We use five pathway hierarchies (cell cycle, DNA repair, diseases, signal transduction, and metabolism), which are obtained from the Reactome Pathway Database, as the architecture of VNN for our XMR model to predict drug responses of triple negative breast cancer. Results: We find that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art interpretable deep learning models in terms of predictive performance. In addition, our model can provide biological insights into explaining drug responses for triple-negative breast cancer. Discussion: Overall, combining both VNN and GNN in a multimodal fusion layer, XMR captures key genomic and molecular features and offers reasonable interpretability in biology, thereby better predicting drug responses in cancer patients. Our model would also benefit personalized cancer therapy in the future.",0.16470962835815045,other,Unknown

METHODS: A training dataset was built from MRIs acquired from January 2017 to June 2021, including patients with knee symptoms, irrespective of ACL ruptures. An external validation dataset was built from MRIs acquired from January 2021 to June 2022, including patients who underwent knee arthroscopy or arthroplasty. Patients with fractures or prior knee surgeries were excluded in both datasets. Subsequently, a deep learning model was developed and validated using these datasets. Clinicians of varying expertise levels in sports medicine and radiology were recruited, and their capacities in diagnosing ACL injuries in terms of accuracy and diagnosing time were evaluated both with and without artificial intelligence (AI) assistance.
RESULTS: A deep learning model was developed based on the training dataset of 22,767 MRIs from 5 centers and verified with external validation dataset of 4,086 MRIs from 6 centers. The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.987 and a sensitivity and specificity of 95.1%. Thirty-eight clinicians from 25 centers were recruited to diagnose 3,800 MRIs. The AI assistance significantly improved the accuracy of all clinicians, exceeding 96%. Additionally, a notable reduction in diagnostic time was observed. The most significant improvements in accuracy and time efficiency were observed in the trainee groups, suggesting that AI support is particularly beneficial for clinicians with moderately limited diagnostic expertise.

Several automated risk prediction models have been developed using retrospective clinical data and have evolved significantly over the years in terms of predictors of recurrence, data usage, and predictive techniques (statistical/machine learning [ML]).
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic literature review of the aforementioned statistical and ML models published between January 2008 and December 2022 through searching five digital databases-PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science. The comprehensive search yielded a total of 163 papers and after a screening process focusing on papers that dealt exclusively with statistical/ML methods, only 23 papers were deemed appropriate for further analysis. We benchmarked the studies on the basis of development, evaluation metrics, and validation strategy with an added emphasis on racial diversity of patients included in the studies.
RESULTS: In total, 30.4% of the included studies use statistical techniques, while 69.6% are ML-based. Among these, traditional ML models (support vector machines, decision tree, logistic regression, and naïve Bayes) are the most frequently used (26.1%) along with deep learning (26.1%). Deep learning and ensemble learning provide the most accurate predictions (AUC = 0.94 each).
CONCLUSION: ML-based prediction models exhibit outstanding performance, yet their practical applicability might be hindered by limited interpretability and reduced generalization. Moreover, predictive models for BC recurrence often focus on limited variables related to tumor, treatment, molecular, and clinical features. Imbalanced classes and the lack of open-source data sets impede model development and validation. Furthermore, existing models predominantly overlook African and Middle Eastern populations, as they are trained and validated mainly on Caucasian and Asian patients.",0.12496903878412027,other,"logistic regression, decision tree"

This study aims to investigate how the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for glaucoma diagnosis can be improved by addressing imbalanced learning issues through utilizing glaucoma suspect samples, which are often excluded from studies because they are a mixture of healthy and preperimetric glaucomatous eyes, in a semi-supervised learning approach.
METHODS: A baseline 3D CNN was developed and trained on a real-world glaucoma dataset, which is naturally imbalanced (like many other real-world medical datasets). Then, three methods, including reweighting samples, data resampling to form balanced batches, and semi-supervised learning on glaucoma suspect data were applied to practically assess their impacts on the performances of the trained methods.
RESULTS: The proposed method achieved a mean accuracy of 95.24%, an F1 score of 97.42%, and an area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic (AUC ROC) of 95.64%, whereas the corresponding results for the traditional supervised training using weighted cross-entropy loss were 92.88%, 96.12%, and 92.72%, respectively. The obtained results show statistically significant improvements in all metrics.
CONCLUSIONS: Exploiting glaucoma suspect eyes in a semi-supervised learning method coupled with resampling can improve glaucoma diagnosis performance by mitigating imbalanced learning issues.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Clinical imbalanced datasets may negatively affect medical applications of deep learning. Utilizing data with uncertain diagnosis, such as glaucoma suspects, through a combination of semi-supervised learning and class-imbalanced learning strategies can partially address the problems of having limited data and learning on imbalanced datasets.",0.1723291334185623,computer vision,CNN

The current study aimed to use deep learning algorithms to develop a prediction model for the prognosis of patients with long bone sarcoma.
METHODS: Data of patients with long bone sarcoma in the extremities was collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database from 2004 to 2014. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to select possible prediction features. DeepSurv, a deep learning model, was constructed for predicting cancer-specific survival rates.

Epub 2023 Jun 23.,Wang Y,Eur J Cancer,2023,2023/07/26,,,10.1016/j.ejca.2023.112953,"BACKGROUND: Intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) causes diagnostic challenges and increases the risk for disease recurrence. Quantification of ITH is challenging and has not been demonstrated in large studies. It has previously been shown that deep learning can enable spatially resolved prediction of molecular phenotypes from digital histopathology whole slide images (WSIs). Here we propose a novel method (Deep-ITH) to predict and measure ITH, and we evaluate its prognostic performance in breast cancer.
METHODS: Deep convolutional neural networks were used to spatially predict gene-expression (PAM50 set) from WSIs. For each predicted transcript, 12 measures of heterogeneity were extracted in the training data set (N = 931). A prognostic score to dichotomise patients into Deep-ITH low- and high-risk groups was established using an elastic-net regularised Cox proportional hazards model (recurrence-free survival). Prognostic performance was evaluated in two independent data sets: SöS-BC-1 (N = 1358) and SCAN-B-Lund (N = 1262).
RESULTS: We observed an increase in risk of recurrence in the high-risk group with hazard ratio (HR) 2.11 (95%CI:1.22-3.60; p = 0.007) using nested cross-validation. Subgroup analyses confirmed the prognostic performance in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, grade 3, and large tumour subgroups. The prognostic value was confirmed in the independent SöS-BC-1 cohort (HR=1.84; 95%CI:1.03-3.3; p = 3.99 ×10-2).

Recent studies that leveraged information from complementary multimodal data improved prognostication, further illustrating the potential utility of such methods. However, current approaches: 1) do not comprehensively leverage biological and histomorphological relationships and 2) make use of emerging strategies to ""pretrain"" models (i.e., train models on a slightly orthogonal dataset/modeling objective) which may aid prognostication by reducing the amount of information required for achieving optimal performance. In addition, model interpretation is crucial for facilitating the clinical adoption of deep learning methods by fostering practitioner understanding and trust in the technology.
METHODS: Here, we develop an interpretable multimodal modeling framework that combines DNA methylation, gene expression, and histopathology (i.e., tissue slides) data, and we compare performance of crossmodal pretraining, contrastive learning, and transfer learning versus the standard procedure.

In order to make the suggested deep learning architecture for the analysis of radiological images more understandable and interpretable, we also implemented the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) based colour visualization approach to all of the tests. As a result, the architecture achieves a classification accuracy rate of 0.96, thus producing excellent results.",0.12599513129386125,computer vision,Unknown

This costly and time-consuming approach is unfit for long-term studies as well as assessment of sleep on a population level. With the vast amount of physiological data becoming available from wrist-worn devices, deep learning techniques provide an opportunity for fast and reliable automatic sleep-stage classification tasks. However, training a deep neural network requires large annotated sleep databases, which are not available for long-term epidemiological studies. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end temporal convolutional neural network able to automatically score sleep stages from raw heartbeat RR interval (RRI) and wrist actigraphy data. Moreover, a transfer learning approach enables the training of the network on a large public database (Sleep Heart Health Study, SHHS) and its subsequent application to a much smaller database recorded by a wristband device. The transfer learning significantly shortens training time and improves sleep-scoring accuracy from 68.9% to 73.8% and inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa) from 0.51 to 0.59. We also found that for the SHHS database, automatic sleep-scoring accuracy using deep learning shows a logarithmic relationship with the training size. Although deep learning approaches for automatic sleep scoring are not yet comparable to the inter-rater reliability among sleep technicians, performance is expected to significantly improve in the near future when more large public databases become available. We anticipate those deep learning techniques, when combined with our transfer learning approach, will leverage automatic sleep scoring of physiological data from wearable devices and enable the investigation of sleep in large cohort studies.",0.1704363012471783,computer vision,Unknown

Thus, preventive, and early CVD risk identification in a non-invasive manner is vital as healthcare cost is increasing day by day. Conventional methods for risk prediction of CVD lack robustness due to the non-linear relationship between risk factors and cardiovascular events in multi-ethnic cohorts. Few recently proposed machine learning-based risk stratification reviews without deep learning (DL) integration. The proposed study focuses on CVD risk stratification by the use of techniques mainly solo deep learning (SDL) and hybrid deep learning (HDL). Using a PRISMA model, 286 DL-based CVD studies were selected and analyzed. The databases included were Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Google Scholar. This review is focused on different SDL and HDL architectures, their characteristics, applications, scientific and clinical validation, along with plaque tissue characterization for CVD/stroke risk stratification. Since signal processing methods are also crucial, the study further briefly presented Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based solutions. Finally, the study presented the risk due to bias in AI systems. The risk of bias tools used were (I) ranking method (RBS), (II) region-based map (RBM), (III) radial bias area (RBA), (IV) prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST), and (V) risk of bias in non-randomized studies-of interventions (ROBINS-I). The surrogate carotid ultrasound image was mostly used in the UNet-based DL framework for arterial wall segmentation. Ground truth (GT) selection is vital for reducing the risk of bias (RoB) for CVD risk stratification. It was observed that the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms were widely used since the feature extraction process was automated. The ensemble-based DL techniques for risk stratification in CVD are likely to supersede the SDL and HDL paradigms. Due to the reliability, high accuracy, and faster execution on dedicated hardware, these DL methods for CVD risk assessment are powerful and promising. The risk of bias in DL methods can be best reduced by considering multicentre data collection and clinical evaluation.",0.10049791524310275,computer vision,CNN

In this article, we investigate the capabilities of a specific deep learning model, a generative adversarial network (GAN), and explore its potential for enhancing the telemedicine approach to cancer pain management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We implemented a structured dataset comprising demographic and clinical variables from 226 patients and 489 telemedicine visits for cancer pain management. The deep learning model, specifically a conditional GAN, was employed to generate synthetic samples that closely resemble real individuals in terms of their characteristics. Subsequently, four machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to assess the variables associated with a higher number of remote visits.
RESULTS: The generated dataset exhibits a distribution comparable to the reference dataset for all considered variables, including age, number of visits, tumor type, performance status, characteristics of metastasis, opioid dosage, and type of pain. Among the algorithms tested, random forest demonstrated the highest performance in predicting a higher number of remote visits, achieving an accuracy of 0.8 on the test data. The simulations based on ML indicated that individuals who are younger than 45 years old, and those experiencing breakthrough cancer pain, may require an increased number of telemedicine-based clinical evaluations.
CONCLUSION: As the advancement of healthcare processes relies on scientific evidence, AI techniques such as GANs can play a vital role in bridging knowledge gaps and accelerating the integration of telemedicine into clinical practice.

Deep learning has been widely used to detect POAG using fundus images as its performance is comparable to or even surpasses diagnosis by clinicians. However, human bias in clinical diagnosis may be reflected and amplified in the widely-used deep learning models, thus impacting their performance. Biases may cause (1) underdiagnosis, increasing the risks of delayed or inadequate treatment, and (2) overdiagnosis, which may increase individuals' stress, fear, well-being, and unnecessary/costly treatment. In this study, we examined the underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis when applying deep learning in POAG detection based on the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) from 22 centers across 16 states in the United States. Our results show that the widely-used deep learning model can underdiagnose or overdiagnose under-served populations. The most underdiagnosed group is female younger (< 60 yrs) group, and the most overdiagnosed group is Black older (≥ 60 yrs) group. Biased diagnosis through traditional deep learning methods may delay disease detection, treatment and create burdens among under-served populations, thereby, raising ethical concerns about using deep learning models in ophthalmology clinics.",0.27224636084944,computer vision,Unknown

To improve patient prognosis predictions and subsequent treatment strategies, it is imperative to develop advanced computational methods to analyze large-scale, high-dimensional genomic data. However, traditional machine learning methods face a challenge in handling the high-dimensional, low-sample size problem that is shown in most genomic data sets. To address this, our group has developed geometric network analysis techniques on multi-omics data in connection with prior biological knowledge derived from protein-protein interactions (PPIs) or pathways. Geometric features obtained from the genomic network, such as Ollivier-Ricci curvature and the invariant measure of the associated Markov chain, have been shown to be predictive of survival outcomes in various cancers. In this study, we propose a novel supervised deep learning method called geometric graph neural network (GGNN) that incorporates such geometric features into deep learning for enhanced predictive power and interpretability. More specifically, we utilize a state-of-the-art graph neural network with sparse connections between the hidden layers based on known biology of the PPI network and pathway information. Geometric features along with multi-omics data are then incorporated into the corresponding layers. The proposed approach utilizes a local-global principle in such a manner that highly predictive features are selected at the front layers and fed directly to the last layer for multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling. The method was applied to multi-omics data from the CoMMpass study of multiple myeloma and ten major cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

They have complex clinical phenotypes often associated with transnosographic dimensions, such as emotion dysregulation and executive dysfunction, that lead to adverse impacts in personal, social, academic, and occupational functioning. Strong overlap exists then across NDDs phenotypes that are challenging for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Recently, digital epidemiology uses the rapidly growing data streams from various devices to advance our understanding of health's and disorders' dynamics, both in individuals and the general population, once coupled with computational science. An alternative transdiagnostic approach using digital epidemiology may thus better help understanding brain functioning and hereby NDDs in the general population.
OBJECTIVE: The EPIDIA4Kids study aims to propose and evaluate in children, a new transdiagnostic approach for brain functioning examination, combining AI-based multimodality biometry and clinical e-assessments on an unmodified tablet. We will examine this digital epidemiology approach in an ecological context through data-driven methods to characterize cognition, emotion, and behavior, and ultimately the potential of transdiagnostic models of NDDs for children in real-life practice.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The EPIDIA4Kids is an uncontrolled open-label study. 786 participants will be recruited and enrolled if eligible: they are (1) aged 7 to 12 years and (2) are French speaker/reader; (3) have no severe intellectual deficiencies. Legal representative and children will complete online demographic, psychosocial and health assessments.

The lack of specific drugs and ready-to-use vaccines to prevent most of these epidemics worsens the situation. These force public health officials and policymakers to rely on early warning systems generated by accurate and reliable epidemic forecasters. Accurate forecasts of epidemics can assist stakeholders in tailoring countermeasures, such as vaccination campaigns, staff scheduling, and resource allocation, to the situation at hand, which could translate to reductions in the impact of a disease. Unfortunately, most of these past epidemics exhibit nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics due to their spreading fluctuations based on seasonal-dependent variability and the nature of these epidemics. We analyze various epidemic time series datasets using a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) based autoregressive neural network and call it Ensemble Wavelet Neural Network (EWNet) model. MODWT techniques effectively characterize non-stationary behavior and seasonal dependencies in the epidemic time series and improve the nonlinear forecasting scheme of the autoregressive neural network in the proposed ensemble wavelet network framework. From a nonlinear time series viewpoint, we explore the asymptotic stationarity of the proposed EWNet model to show the asymptotic behavior of the associated Markov Chain. We also theoretically investigate the effect of learning stability and the choice of hidden neurons in the proposal. From a practical perspective, we compare our proposed EWNet framework with twenty-two statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models for fifteen real-world epidemic datasets with three test horizons using four key performance indicators.

DESIGN: Deep learning model development.
PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred eleven participants from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 Ancillary SD-OCT Study.
METHODS: A dataset of 1284 SD-OCT scans from 311 participants was used to develop Deep-GA-Net. Cross-validation was used to evaluate Deep-GA-Net, where each testing set contained no participant from the corresponding training set. En face heatmaps and important regions at the B-scan level were used to visualize the outputs of Deep-GA-Net, and 3 ophthalmologists graded the presence or absence of GA in them to assess the explainability (i.e., understandability and interpretability) of its detections.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accuracy, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), area under precision-recall curve (APR).
RESULTS: Compared with other networks, Deep-GA-Net achieved the best metrics, with accuracy of 0.93, AUC of 0.94, and APR of 0.91, and received the best gradings of 0.98 and 0.68 on the en face heatmap and B-scan grading tasks, respectively.

Correlating histomorphometric features with clinical parameters through machine learning approaches can provide valuable information about natural population variance. To this end, we leveraged deep learning, computational image analysis, and feature analysis to investigate the relationship of histomorphometry with patient age, sex, and serum creatinine (SCr) in a multinational set of reference kidney tissue sections.
METHODS: A panoptic segmentation neural network was developed and used to segment viable and sclerotic glomeruli, cortical and medullary interstitia, tubules, and arteries/arterioles in the digitized images of 79 periodic acid-Schiff-stained human nephrectomy sections showing minimal pathologic changes. Simple morphometrics (e.g., area, radius, density) were quantified from the segmented classes. Regression analysis aided in determining the relationship of histomorphometric parameters with age, sex, and SCr.
RESULTS: Our deep-learning model achieved high segmentation performance for all test compartments. The size and density of nephrons and arteries/arterioles varied significantly among healthy humans, with potentially large differences between geographically diverse patients. Nephron size was significantly dependent on SCr. Slight, albeit significant, differences in renal vasculature were observed between sexes. Glomerulosclerosis percentage increased, and cortical density of arteries/arterioles decreased, as a function of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Using deep learning, we automated precise measurements of kidney histomorphometric features. In the reference kidney tissue, several histomorphometric features demonstrated significant correlation to patient demographics and SCr.

As viruses have highly mutable genomes, new viruses may emerge in the future, such as COVID-19 and influenza. Traditional virology relies on predefined rules to identify viruses, but new viruses may be completely or partially divergent from the reference genome, rendering statistical methods and similarity calculations insufficient for all genome sequences. Identifying DNA/RNA-based viral sequences is a crucial step in differentiating different types of lethal pathogens, including their variants and strains. While various tools in bioinformatics can align them, expert biologists are required to interpret the results. Computational virology is a scientific field that studies viruses, their origins, and drug discovery, where machine learning plays a crucial role in extracting domain- and task-specific features to tackle this challenge.

There is no accurate predictive method for its prognosis. Artificial intelligence deep learning may bring new hope.
METHODS: By searching the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (SEER), 21,093 patients' clinical data were eventually included. Data were then divided into two groups (train dataset/test dataset). The train dataset (diagnosed in 2010-2014, N = 17,296) was utilized to conduct a deep learning survival model, validated by itself and the test dataset (diagnosed in 2015, N = 3,797) in parallel.

RESULTS: In a subregion with an extremely high imbalance ratio, the model achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.84, a PR-AUC of 0.10, a sensitivity of 0, and a specificity of 1.
CONCLUSION: The commonly used ROC curve is not sufficiently informative, especially in the case of imbalanced data. We provide the following practical suggestions based on our data analysis: 1) ROC-AUC is recommended for balanced data, 2) PR-AUC should be used for moderately imbalanced data (i.e., when the proportion of the minor class is above 5% and less than 50%), and 3) for severely imbalanced data (i.e., when the proportion of the minor class is below 5%), it is not practical to apply a deep learning model, even with the application of techniques addressing imbalanced data issues.",0.12034202386494908,other,Unknown

However, multi-batch data, as well as extracted radiomic features, exhibit pronounced technical artifacts across batches. These batch effects introduce confounding into the data and can obscure biological effects of interest, decreasing the generalizability and reproducibility of findings. This is especially true when multi-batch data is used alongside complex downstream analysis models, such as machine learning methods. Image harmonization methods seeking to remove these batch effects are important for mitigating these issues; however, significant multivariate batch effects remain in the data following harmonization by current state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning methods. We present DeepCombat, a deep learning harmonization method based on a conditional variational autoencoder architecture and the ComBat harmonization model. DeepCombat learns and removes subject-level batch effects by accounting for the multivariate relationships between features. Additionally, DeepComBat relaxes a number of strong assumptions commonly made by previous deep learning harmonization methods and is empirically robust across a wide range of hyperparameter choices. We apply this method to neuroimaging data from a large cognitive-aging cohort and find that DeepCombat outperforms existing methods, as assessed by a battery of machine learning methods, in removing scanner effects from cortical thickness measurements while preserving biological heterogeneity. Additionally, DeepComBat provides a new perspective for statistically-motivated deep learning harmonization methods.",0.15735666400720805,computer vision,autoencoder

We validated and visualized the novel staging system based on DeepSurv using data from multiple cohorts.
METHODS: Totally 6020 ESCC patients diagnosed from January 2010 to December 2018 were included in the present study from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (SEER), randomly assigned to the training and test cohorts. We developed, validated and visualized a deep learning model that included 16 prognostic factors; then a novel staging system was further constructed based on the total risk score derived from the deep learning model. The classification performance at 3-year and 5-year OS was assessed by the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Calibration curve and the Harrell's concordance index (C-index) were also used to comprehensively assess the predictive performance of the deep learning model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was utilized to assess the clinical utility of the novel staging system.
RESULTS: A more applicable and accurate deep learning model was established, which outperformed the traditional nomogram in predicting OS in the test cohort (C-index: 0.732 [95% CI 0.714-0.750] versus 0.671 [95% CI 0.647-0.695]). The ROC curves at 3-year and 5-year OS for the model also showed good discrimination ability in the test cohort (Area Under the Curve [AUC] at 3-/5-year OS = 0.805/0.825). Moreover, using our novel staging system, we observed a clear survival difference among different risk groups (P < 0.001) and a significant positive net benefit in the DCA.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel deep learning-based staging system was constructed for patients with ESCC, which performed a significant discriminability for survival probability. Moreover, an easy-to-use web-based tool based on the deep learning model was also implemented, offering convenience for personalized survival prediction. We developed a deep learning-based system that stages patients with ESCC according to their survival probability. We also created a web-based tool that uses this system to predict individual survival outcomes.",0.287629296211791,other,Unknown

Current tools based on DNA sequencing or microsatellite analysis require specific manipulations that are difficult to implement in the context of routine diagnosis. Using deep learning to classify the mass spectra obtained during the routine identification of fungi by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry could be of interest to differentiate isolates belonging to epidemic clones from others. As part of the management of a nosocomial outbreak due to Candida parapsilosis in two Parisian hospitals, we studied the impact of the preparation of the spectra on the performance of a deep neural network. Our purpose was to differentiate 39 otherwise fluconazole-resistant isolates belonging to a clonal subset from 56 other isolates, most of which were fluconazole-susceptible, collected during the same period and not belonging to the clonal subset. Our study carried out on spectra obtained on four different machines from isolates cultured for 24 or 48 h on three different culture media showed that each of these parameters had a significant impact on the performance of the classifier. In particular, using different culture times between learning and testing steps could lead to a collapse in the accuracy of the predictions. On the other hand, including spectra obtained after 24 and 48 h of growth during the learning step restored the good results. Finally, we showed that the deleterious effect of the device variability used for learning and testing could be largely improved by including a spectra alignment step during preprocessing before submitting them to the neural network. Taken together, these experiments show the great potential of deep learning models to identify spectra of specific clones, providing that crucial parameters are controlled during both culture and preparation steps before submitting spectra to a classifier.",0.1270940577598397,other,Unknown

It is the most aggressive type of diffuse glioma and has a median survival of months after treatment. This study aims to assess the accuracy of different novel deep learning models trained on a set of simple clinical, demographic, and surgical variables to assist in clinical practice, even in areas with constrained health care infrastructure.
METHODS: Our study included 37,095 patients with GBM from the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) database. All predictors were based on demographic, clinicopathologic, and treatment information of the cases. Our outcomes of interest were months of survival and vital status. Concordance index (C-index) and integrated Brier scores (IBS) were used to evaluate the performance of the models.
RESULTS: The patient characteristics and the statistical analyses were consistent with the epidemiologic literature. The models C-index and IBS ranged from 0.6743 to 0.6918 and from 0.0934 to 0.1034, respectively. Probabilistic matrix factorization (0.6918), multitask logistic regression (0.6916), and logistic hazard (0.6916) had the highest C-index scores. The models with the lowest IBS were the probabilistic matrix factorization (0.0934), multitask logistic regression (0.0935), and logistic hazard (0.0936). These models had an accuracy (1-IBS) of 90.66%; 90.65%, and 90.64%, respectively. The deep learning algorithms were deployed on an interactive Web-based tool for practical use available via https://glioblastoma-survanalysis.herokuapp.com/.

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study design using the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students questionnaire. The questionnaire gives rise to three possible learning approaches; deep, strategic and surface approaches. Bivariate analyses were performed through independent samples t-test and χ2 tests where appropriate. A multinominal regression analysis was performed to obtain risk estimates and 95% CIs.
RESULTS: A total of 3767 students participated and were included in the analysis. The predominant learning approach was the deep approach, followed by the strategic and surface approaches (40.59%, 37.81% and 21.60%, respectively). Males and students belonging to private medical schools were more likely to adopt a strategic rather than a deep one (relative risk ratio (RRR) 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.42 and RRR 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.65, respectively). Students with an A grade point average (GPA) were less likely to adopt a surface approach, whereas those with a C GPA were more likely to adopt it (RRR=0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83 and RRR=1.29, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.61, respectively).

Deep learning-based models may not perform optimally in real-world populations due to variations in variables and characteristics. Transfer learning, on the other hand, enables a model developed for one domain to be adapted for a related domain. Our objective was to integrate deep learning and transfer learning to create a multivariable survival model for lung cancer.
METHODS: We collected data from 601,480 lung cancer patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and 4,512 lung cancer patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (GYFY) database. The primary model was trained with the SEER database, internally validated with a dataset from SEER, and externally validated through transfer learning with the GYFY database. The performance of the model was compared with a traditional Cox model by C-indexes. We also explored the model's performance in the setting of missing data and generated the artificial intelligence (AI) certainty of the prediction.
RESULTS: The C-indexes in the training dataset (SEER full sample) with DeepSurv and Cox model were 0.792 (0.791-0.792) and 0.714 (0.713-0.715), respectively. The values were 0.727 (0.704-0.750) and 0.692 (0.666-0.718) after applying the trained model in the test dataset (GYFY). The AI certainty of the DeepSurv model output was from 0.98 to 1. For transfer learning through fine-tuning, the results showed that the test set could achieve a higher C-index (20% vs. 30% fine-tuning data) with more fine-tuning dataset. Besides, the DeepSurv model was more accurate than the traditional Cox model in predicting with missing data, after random data loss of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and median fill-in missing values.
CONCLUSIONS: The model outperformed the traditional Cox model, was robust with missing data and provided the AI certainty of prediction. It can be used for patient self-evaluation and risk stratification in clinical trials. Researchers can fine-tune the pre-trained model and integrate their own database to explore other prognostic factors.",0.19726998786312305,other,Unknown

We created our deep learning (DL) model to manipulate the data and evaluated its performance against four other competitive models. We tried to demonstrate a new grouping system oriented by survival outcomes and process personalized survival prediction by using our DL model.
RESULTS: The DL model reached 0.878 c-index and 0.09 Brier score in the test set, which was better than the other four models. In the external test set, our model achieved a 0.80 c-index and 0.13 Brier score. Thus, we developed prognosis-oriented risk grouping for patients according to risk scores computed by our DL model. Notable differences among groupings were observed. In addition, a personalized survival prediction system based on our risk-scoring grouping was developed.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a deep neural network model for cervical adenocarcinoma patients. The performance of this model proved to be superior to other models.

This study fused deep learning with a regularized nomogram to construct a novel deep learning nomogram from CGM profiles to identify patients at high risk of DR. Specifically, a deep learning network was employed to mine the nonlinear relationship between CGM profiles and DR. Moreover, a novel nomogram combining CGM deep factors with basic information was established to score the patients' DR risk. This dataset consists of 788 patients belonging to two cohorts: 494 in the training cohort and 294 in the testing cohort. The area under the curve (AUC) values of our deep learning nomogram were 0.82 and 0.80 in the training cohort and testing cohort, respectively. By incorporating basic clinical factors, the deep learning nomogram achieved an AUC of 0.86 in the training cohort and 0.85 in the testing cohort.

However, in many scenarios, the number of imaging sequences capturing information related to small vessel disease lesions is insufficient to support data-driven techniques. Additionally, cohort-based studies may not always have the optimal or essential imaging sequences for accurate lesion detection. Therefore, it is necessary to determine which imaging sequences are crucial for precise detection. This study introduces a deep learning framework to detect enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS) and aims to find the optimal combination of MRI sequences for deep learning-based quantification. We implemented an effective lightweight U-Net adapted for ePVS detection and comprehensively investigated different combinations of information from SWI, FLAIR, T1-weighted (T1w), and T2-weighted (T2w) MRI sequences. The experimental results showed that T2w MRI is the most important for accurate ePVS detection, and the incorporation of SWI, FLAIR and T1w MRI in the deep neural network had minor improvements in accuracy and resulted in the highest sensitivity and precision (sensitivity =0.82, precision =0.83). The proposed method achieved comparable accuracy at a minimal time cost compared to manual reading. The proposed automated pipeline enables robust and time-efficient readings of ePVS from MR scans and demonstrates the importance of T2w MRI for ePVS detection and the potential benefits of using multimodal images. Furthermore, the model provides whole-brain maps of ePVS, enabling a better understanding of their clinical correlates compared to the clinical rating methods within only a couple of brain regions.",0.1328946441333419,computer vision,Unknown

This study aimed to develop and validate survival prediction models for gastric adenocarcinoma patients using the deep learning survival neural network.
METHODS: A total of 14,177 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were included in the study and randomly divided into the training and testing group with a 7:3 ratio. Two algorithms were chosen to build the prediction models, and both algorithms include random survival forest (RSF) and a deep learning based-survival prediction algorithm (DeepSurv).

The DeepSurv model produced superior accuracy and calibrated survival estimates predicting 1-, 3- 5- and 10-year survival (AUC: 0.825-0.871).
CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning algorithm was developed to predict more accurate prognostic information for gastric cancer patients. The DeepSurv model has advantages over the CoxPH and RSF models and performs well in discriminative performance and calibration.",0.10550250911781228,other,Unknown

There is considerable clinical significance and an emerging need of early detection of these diseases for preventive treatment success before more severe arrhythmias occur. However, developing such early screening tools is challenging due to the lack of early electrocardiograms (ECGs) before symptoms occur in patients. Mouse models are widely used in cardiac arrhythmia research. The goal of this paper is to develop deep learning models to predict cardiac conduction diseases in mice using their early ECGs. We hypothesize that mutant mice present subtle abnormalities in their early ECGs before severe arrhythmias present. These subtle patterns can be detected by deep learning though they are hard to be identified by human eyes. We propose a deep transfer learning model, DeepMiceTL, which leverages knowledge from human ECGs to learn mouse ECG patterns. We further apply the Bayesian optimization and $k$-fold cross validation methods to tune the hyperparameters of the DeepMiceTL. Our results show that DeepMiceTL achieves a promising performance (F1-score: 83.8%, accuracy: 84.8%) in predicting the occurrence of cardiac conduction diseases using early mouse ECGs. This study is among the first efforts that use state-of-the-art deep transfer learning to identify ECG patterns during the early course of cardiac conduction disease in mice. Our approach not only could help in cardiac conduction disease research in mice, but also suggest a feasibility for early clinical diagnosis of human cardiac conduction diseases and other types of cardiac arrythmias using deep transfer learning in the future.",0.1589496023200706,other,Unknown

With the recent global pandemic of COVID-19, the need to research strategies to treat these health problems has become even more pressing. Although the literature on big data and data science in health has grown rapidly, few studies have synthesized these individual studies, and none has identified the utility of big data in infectious disease surveillance and modeling.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to synthesize research and identify hotspots of big data in infectious disease epidemiology.
METHODS: Bibliometric data from 3054 documents that satisfied the inclusion criteria retrieved from the Web of Science database over 22 years (2000-2022) were analyzed and reviewed. The search retrieval occurred on October 17, 2022. Bibliometric analysis was performed to illustrate the relationships between research constituents, topics, and key terms in the retrieved documents.
RESULTS: The bibliometric analysis revealed internet searches and social media as the most utilized big data sources for infectious disease surveillance or modeling. The analysis also placed US and Chinese institutions as leaders in this research area. Disease monitoring and surveillance, utility of electronic health (or medical) records, methodology framework for infodemiology tools, and machine/deep learning were identified as the core research themes.

Epidemiologic Information (EI) regarding prevalence and incidence data of rare diseases is sparse and current paradigms of identifying, extracting, and curating EI rely upon time-intensive, error-prone manual processes. With these limitations, a clear understanding of the variation in epidemiology and outcomes for rare disease patients is hampered. This challenges the public health of rare diseases patients through a lack of information necessary to prioritize research, policy decisions, therapeutic development, and health system allocations.
METHODS: In this study, we developed a newly curated epidemiology corpus for Named Entity Recognition (NER), a deep learning framework, and a novel rare disease epidemiologic information pipeline named EpiPipeline4RD consisting of a web interface and Restful API. For the corpus creation, we programmatically gathered a representative sample of rare disease epidemiologic abstracts, utilized weakly-supervised machine learning techniques to label the dataset, and manually validated the labeled dataset. For the deep learning framework development, we fine-tuned our dataset and adapted the BioBERT model for NER. We measured the performance of our BioBERT model for epidemiology entity recognition quantitatively with precision, recall, and F1 and qualitatively through a comparison with Orphanet. We demonstrated the ability for our pipeline to gather, identify, and extract epidemiology information from rare disease abstracts through three case studies.
RESULTS: We developed a deep learning model to extract EI with overall F1 scores of 0.817 and 0.878, evaluated at the entity-level and token-level respectively, and which achieved comparable qualitative results to Orphanet's collection paradigm. Additionally, case studies of the rare diseases Classic homocystinuria, GRACILE syndrome, Phenylketonuria demonstrated the adequate recall of abstracts with epidemiology information, high precision of epidemiology information extraction through our deep learning model, and the increased efficiency of EpiPipeline4RD compared to a manual curation paradigm.
CONCLUSIONS: EpiPipeline4RD demonstrated high performance of EI extraction from rare disease literature to augment manual curation processes. This automated information curation paradigm will not only effectively empower development of the NIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD), but also support the public health of the rare disease community.",0.19944230189865025,text mining,Unknown

However, there has been a lack of development in deep learning for G-E interaction analysis. In this article, we fill this important knowledge gap and develop a new analysis approach based on deep neural network in conjunction with penalization. The proposed approach can simultaneously conduct model estimation and selection (of important main G effects and G-E interactions), while uniquely respecting the ""main effects, interactions"" variable selection hierarchy.

Children with ANH are surveilled with repeated renal ultrasound and when there is high suspicion for a ureteropelvic junction obstruction on renal ultrasound, a mercaptuacetyltriglycerine (MAG3) Lasix renal scan is performed to evaluate for obstruction. However, the challenging interpretation of MAG3 renal scans places patients at risk of misdiagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to analyze MAG3 renal scans using machine learning to predict renal complications. We hypothesized that our deep learning model would extract features from MAG3 renal scans that can predict renal complications in children with ANH.
STUDY DESIGN: We performed a case-control study of MAG3 studies drawn from a population of children with ANH concerning for ureteropelvic junction obstruction evaluated at our institution from January 2009 until June of 2021. The outcome was renal complications that occur ≥6 months after an equivocal MAG-3 renal scan. We created two machine learning models: a deep learning model using the radiotracer concentration versus time data from the kidney of interest and a random forest model created using clinical data. The performance of the models was assessed using measures of diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: We identified 152 eligible patients with available images of which 62 were cases and 90 were controls. The deep learning model predicted future renal complications with an overall accuracy of 73% (95% confidence inteveral [CI] 68-76%) and an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.7, 0.84). The random forest model had an accuracy of 62% (95% CI 60-66%) and an AUC of 0.67 (95% CI. 0 64, 0.72) DISCUSSION: Our deep learning model predicted patients at high risk of developing renal complications following an equivocal renal scan and discriminate those at low risk with moderately high accuracy (73%). The deep learning model outperformed the clinical model built from clinical features classically used by urologists for surgical decision making.
CONCLUSION: Our models have the potential to influence clinical decision making by providing supplemental analytical data from MAG3 scans that would not otherwise be available to urologists. Future multi-institutional retrospective and prospective trials are needed to validate our model.",0.14624421491659834,computer vision,random forest

There is a lack of comprehensive research aimed to identify AD-associated risk mutations systematically. To address this challenge, we hereby construct a large-scale AD mutation and co-mutation framework ('AD-Syn-Net'), and propose deep learning models named Deep-SMCI and Deep-CMCI configured with fully connected layers that are capable of predicting cognitive impairment of subjects effectively based on genetic mutation and co-mutation profiles. Next, we apply the customized frameworks to data sets to evaluate the importance scores of the mutations and identified mutation effectors and co-mutation combination vulnerabilities contributing to cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of mutation pairs on the network architecture to dissect the genetic organization of AD and identify novel co-mutations that could be responsible for dementia, laying a solid foundation for proposing future targeted therapy for AD precision medicine.

Deep learning, a model that finds patterns in large samples of data, outperform traditional statistical methods in making predictions. This study aimed to create a deep learning-based model (DLM) to predict postoperative complications in patients with cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).
METHODS: This prospective multicenter study was conducted by the 28 institutions, and 478 patients were included in the analysis. Deep learning was used to create two predictive models of the overall postoperative complications and neurological complications, one of the major complications. These models were constructed by learning the patient's preoperative background, clinical symptoms, surgical procedures, and imaging findings. These logistic regression models were also created, and these accuracies were compared with those of the DLM.
RESULTS: Overall complications were observed in 127 cases (26.6%). The accuracy of the DLM was 74.6 ± 3.7% for predicting the overall occurrence of complications, which was comparable to that of the logistic regression (74.1%). Neurological complications were observed in 48 cases (10.0%), and the accuracy of the DLM was 91.7 ± 3.5%, which was higher than that of the logistic regression (90.1%).
CONCLUSION: A new algorithm using deep learning was able to predict complications after cervical OPLL surgery. This model was well calibrated, with prediction accuracy comparable to that of regression models. The accuracy remained high even for predicting only neurological complications, for which the case number is limited compared to conventional statistical methods.",0.17750009693536742,other,logistic regression

In recent years, neural network models have gained increasing popularity with their success in image recognition and text classification. Various survival neural network models have been proposed by combining survival analysis and neural network architecture to take advantage of the strengths from both. However, the performance of these survival neural network models compared to each other and to PCEs in ASCVD prediction is unknown.
METHODS: In this study, we used 6 cohorts from the Lifetime Risk Pooling Project (with 5 cohorts as training/internal validation and one cohort as external validation) and compared the performance of the PCEs in 10-year ASCVD risk prediction with an all two-way interactions Cox PH model (Cox PH-TWI) and three state-of-the-art neural network survival models including Nnet-survival, Deepsurv, and Cox-nnet. For all the models, we used the same 7 covariates as used in the PCEs. We fitted each of the aforementioned models in white females, white males, black females, and black males, respectively. We evaluated models' internal and external discrimination power and calibration.
RESULTS: The training/internal validation sample comprised 23216 individuals. The average age at baseline was 57.8 years old (SD = 9.6); 16% developed ASCVD during average follow-up of 10.50 (SD = 3.02) years. Based on 10 × 10 cross-validation, the method that had the highest C-statistics was Deepsurv (0.7371) for white males, Deepsurv and Cox PH-TWI (0.7972) for white females, PCE (0.6981) for black males, and Deepsurv (0.7886) for black females. In the external validation dataset, Deepsurv (0.7032), Cox-nnet (0.7282), PCE (0.6811), and Deepsurv (0.7316) had the highest C-statistics for white male, white female, black male, and black female population, respectively. Calibration plots showed that in 10 × 10 validation, all models had good calibration in all race and sex groups. In external validation, all models overestimated the risk for 10-year ASCVD.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the use of the state-of-the-art neural network survival models in ASCVD risk prediction. Neural network survival models had similar if not superior discrimination and calibration compared to PCEs.",0.17305794988835468,both,Unknown

For achieving more quicker and accurate detection and prediction, the data recorded on the Internet, especially on the search engine from Google or Baidu are widely introduced into this field. Moreover, with the development of intelligent technology and machine learning algorithm, many updated and advanced trend tracking and forecasting methods are also being used in this research problem.
METHODS: In this paper, a new recurrent neural network architecture, attention-based long short-term memory model is proposed for influenza surveillance. This is a kind of deep learning model which is trained by processing from Baidu Index series so as to fit the real influenza survey time series. Previous studies on influenza surveillance by Baidu Index mostly used traditional autoregressive moving average model or classical machine learning models such as logarithmic linear regression, support vector regression or multi-layer perception model to fit influenza like illness data, which less considered the deep learning structure. Meanwhile, some new model that considered the deep learning structure did not take into account the application of Baidu index data. This study considers introducing the recurrent neural network with long short-term memory combined with attention mechanism into the influenza surveillance research model, which not only fits the research problems well in model structure, but also provides research methods based on Baidu index.
RESULTS: The actual survey data and Baidu Index data are used to train and test the proposed attention-based long short-term memory model and the other comparison models, so as to iterate the value of the model parameters, and to describe and predict the influenza epidemic situation. The experimental results show that our proposed model has better performance in the mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, index of agreement and other indicators than the other comparison models.
CONCLUSION: Our proposed attention-based long short-term memory model vividly verifies the ability of this attention-based long short-term memory structure for better surveillance and prediction the trend of influenza. In comparison with some of the latest models and methods in this research field, the model we proposed is also excellent in effect, even more lightweight and robust.

OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a practical review and tutorial on scalable causal structure learning models with examples of real-world data to help health care audiences understand and apply them.
METHODS: We reviewed traditional (combinatorial and score-based) methods for causal structure discovery and machine learning-based schemes. Various traditional approaches have been studied to tackle this problem, the most important among these being the Peter Spirtes and Clark Glymour algorithms. This was followed by analyzing the literature on score-based methods, which are computationally faster. Owing to the continuous constraint on acyclicity, there are new deep learning approaches to the problem in addition to traditional and score-based methods. Such methods can also offer scalability, particularly when there is a large amount of data involving multiple variables. Using our own evaluation metrics and experiments on linear, nonlinear, and benchmark Sachs data, we aimed to highlight the various advantages and disadvantages associated with these methods for the health care community. We also highlighted recent developments in biomedicine where causal structure learning can be applied to discover structures such as gene networks, brain connectivity networks, and those in cancer epidemiology.
RESULTS: We also compared the performance of traditional and machine learning-based algorithms for causal discovery over some benchmark data sets. Directed Acyclic Graph-Graph Neural Network has the lowest structural hamming distance (19) and false positive rate (0.13) based on the Sachs data set, whereas Greedy Equivalence Search and Max-Min Hill Climbing have the best false discovery rate (0.68) and true positive rate (0.56), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning-based approaches, including deep learning, have many advantages over traditional approaches, such as scalability, including a greater number of variables, and potentially being applied in a wide range of biomedical applications, such as genetics, if sufficient data are available. Furthermore, these models are more flexible than traditional models and are poised to positively affect many applications in the future.",0.15416391145337838,other,Unknown

Combating the opioid crisis requires targeting high-need populations by identifying individuals at risk of OD. While deep learning emerges as a powerful method for building predictive models using large scale electronic health records (EHR), it is challenged by the complex intrinsic relationships among EHR data. Further, its utility is limited by the lack of clinically meaningful explainability, which is necessary for making informed clinical or policy decisions using such models. In this paper, we present LIGHTED, an integrated deep learning model combining long short term memory (LSTM) and graph neural networks (GNN) to predict patients' OD risk. The LIGHTED model can incorporate the temporal effects of disease progression and the knowledge learned from interactions among clinical features. We evaluated the model using Cerner's Health Facts database with over 5 million patients. Our experiments demonstrated that the model outperforms traditional machine learning methods and other deep learning models. We also proposed a novel interpretability method by exploiting embeddings provided by GNNs to cluster patients and EHR features respectively, and conducted qualitative feature cluster analysis for clinical interpretations.

The purpose of this study is to develop two predictive algorithms: one to predict opioid prescription and one to predict OUD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed an informatics algorithm that trains two deep learning models over patient Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using the MIMIC-III database. We utilize both the structured and unstructured parts of the EHR and show that it is possible to predict both challenging outcomes.
RESULTS: Our deep learning models incorporate elements from EHRs to predict opioid prescription with an F1-score of 0.88 ± 0.003 and an AUC-ROC of 0.93 ± 0.002. We also constructed a model to predict OUD diagnosis achieving an F1-score of 0.82 ± 0.05 and AUC-ROC of 0.94 ± 0.008.
DISCUSSION: Our model for OUD prediction outperformed prior algorithms for specificity, F1 score and AUC-ROC while achieving equivalent sensitivity. This demonstrates the importance of a) deep learning approaches in predicting OUD and b) incorporating both structured and unstructured data for this prediction task. No prediction models for opioid prescription as an outcome were found in the literature and therefore our model is the first to predict opioid prescribing behavior.

The conventional model predicted postoperative infections was 0.728 (95% CI 0.688-0.768) with the sensitivity of 66.2% (95% CI 58.2-73.6) and specificity of 66.8% (95% CI 64.6-68.9). The deep learning model including risk factors relevant to baseline clinical characteristics predicted postoperative infections was 0.641 (95% CI 0.545-0.737), and sensitivity and specificity were 34.2% (95% CI 19.6-51.4) and 88.8% (95% CI 85.6-91.6), respectively. Including risk factors relevant to baseline variables and surgery, the deep learning model predicted postoperative infections was 0.763 (95% CI 0.681-0.844) with the sensitivity of 63.2% (95% CI 46-78.2) and specificity of 80.5% (95% CI 76.6-84). Our feasibility study indicated that a deep learning model including risk factors for the prediction of postoperative infections can be achieved in elderly. Further study is needed to assess whether this model can be used to guide clinical practice to improve surgical outcomes in elderly.",0.22015360345512872,other,Unknown

AI has sparsely been evaluated for the monitoring of medication adherence in clinical settings. However, AI has the potential to transform the way health care is delivered even in limited-resource settings such as Africa.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to pilot the development of a deep learning model for simple binary classification and confirmation of proper medication adherence to enhance efficiency in the use of video monitoring of patients in tuberculosis treatment.
METHODS: We used a secondary data set of 861 video images of medication intake that were collected from consenting adult patients with tuberculosis in an institutional review board-approved study evaluating video-observed therapy in Uganda. The video images were processed through a series of steps to prepare them for use in a training model. First, we annotated videos using a specific protocol to eliminate those with poor quality. After the initial annotation step, 497 videos had sufficient quality for training the models. Among them, 405 were positive samples, whereas 92 were negative samples. With some preprocessing techniques, we obtained 160 frames with a size of 224 × 224 in each video. We used a deep learning framework that leveraged 4 convolutional neural networks models to extract visual features from the video frames and automatically perform binary classification of adherence or nonadherence. We evaluated the diagnostic properties of the different models using sensitivity, specificity, F<sub>1</sub>-score, and precision. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess the discriminative performance and the speed per video review as a metric for model efficiency. We conducted a 5-fold internal cross-validation to determine the diagnostic and discriminative performance of the models. We did not conduct external validation due to a lack of publicly available data sets with specific medication intake video frames.
RESULTS: Diagnostic properties and discriminative performance from internal cross-validation were moderate to high in the binary classification tasks with 4 selected automated deep learning models. The sensitivity ranged from 92.8 to 95.8%, specificity from 43.5 to 55.4%, F<sub>1</sub>-score from 0.91 to 0.92, precision from 88% to 90.1%, and AUC from 0.78 to 0.85. The 3D ResNet model had the highest precision, AUC, and speed.
CONCLUSIONS: All 4 deep learning models showed comparable diagnostic properties and discriminative performance. The findings serve as a reasonable proof of concept to support the potential application of AI in the binary classification of video frames to predict medication adherence.",0.1424981658998954,computer vision,ResNet

METHOD: Cases diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2018 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A deep learning survival neural network was developed and validated based on 17 variables, including demographic information, clinicopathological characteristics, and treatment details. Based on the total risk score derived from this algorithm, a novel risk classification system was constructed and compared with the 8th edition of the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging system.
RESULTS: Of 7,764 EAC patients eligible for the study, 6,818 (87.8%) were men and the median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (58-72) years. The deep learning model generated significantly superior predictions to the 8th edition staging system on the test data set (C-index: 0.773 [95% CI, 0.757-0.789] vs. 0.683 [95% CI, 0.667-0.699]; P &lt; 0.001). Calibration curves revealed that the deep learning model was well calibrated for 1- and 3-year OS, most points almost directly distributing on the 45° line. Decision curve analyses (DCAs) showed that the novel risk classification system exhibited a more significant positive net benefit than the TNM staging system. A user-friendly and precise web-based calculator with a portably executable file was implemented to visualize the deep learning predictive model.
CONCLUSION: A deep learning predictive model was developed and validated, which possesses more excellent calibration and discrimination abilities in survival prediction of EAC. The novel risk classification system based on the deep learning algorithm may serve as a useful tool in clinical decision making given its easy-to-use and better clinical applicability.",0.3020268380463321,other,Unknown

The grading of dysplasia and the detection of adenocarcinoma are important clinical tasks in the diagnosis of CRC and shape the patients' follow-up plans. This study evaluated the feasibility of deep learning models for the classification of colorectal lesions into four classes: benign, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma. To this end, a deep neural network was developed on a training set of 655 whole slide images of digitized colorectal resection slides from a tertiary medical institution; and the network was evaluated on an internal test set of 234 slides, as well as on an external test set of 606 adenocarcinoma slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The model achieved an overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95.5%, 91.0%, and 97.1%, respectively, on the internal test set, and an accuracy and sensitivity of 98.5% for adenocarcinoma detection task on the external test set. Results suggest that such deep learning models can potentially assist pathologists in grading colorectal dysplasia, detecting adenocarcinoma, prescreening, and prioritizing the reviewing of suspicious cases to improve the turnaround time for patients with a high risk of CRC.

OBJECTIVE: To derive a single algorithm using deep learning and machine learning for the prediction and identification of factors associated with in-hospital mortality in Asian patients with ACS and to compare performance to a conventional risk score.
METHODS: The Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Database (NCVD) registry, is a multi-ethnic, heterogeneous database spanning from 2006-2017. It was used for in-hospital mortality model development with 54 variables considered for patients with STEMI and Non-STEMI (NSTEMI). Mortality prediction was analyzed using feature selection methods with machine learning algorithms. Deep learning algorithm using features selected from machine learning was compared to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score.
RESULTS: A total of 68528 patients were included in the analysis. Deep learning models constructed using all features and selected features from machine learning resulted in higher performance than machine learning and TIMI risk score (p < 0.0001 for all). The best model in this study is the combination of features selected from the SVM algorithm with a deep learning classifier. The DL (SVM selected var) algorithm demonstrated the highest predictive performance with the least number of predictors (14 predictors) for in-hospital prediction of STEMI patients (AUC = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95-0.96). In NSTEMI in-hospital prediction, DL (RF selected var) (AUC = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95-0.96, reported slightly higher AUC compared to DL (SVM selected var) (AUC = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.94-0.95). There was no significant difference between DL (SVM selected var) algorithm and DL (RF selected var) algorithm (p = 0.5). When compared to the DL (SVM selected var) model, the TIMI score underestimates patients' risk of mortality. TIMI risk score correctly identified 13.08% of the high-risk patient's non-survival vs 24.7% for the DL model and 4.65% vs 19.7% of the high-risk patient's non-survival for NSTEMI. Age, heart rate, Killip class, cardiac catheterization, oral hypoglycemia use and antiarrhythmic agent were found to be common predictors of in-hospital mortality across all ML feature selection models in this study. The final algorithm was converted into an online tool with a database for continuous data archiving for prospective validation.
CONCLUSIONS: ACS patients were better classified using a combination of machine learning and deep learning in a multi-ethnic Asian population when compared to TIMI scoring. Machine learning enables the identification of distinct factors in individual Asian populations to improve mortality prediction. Continuous testing and validation will allow for better risk stratification in the future, potentially altering management and outcomes.",0.18190611999171472,other,SVM

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III as our dataset. We employ positive-unlabeled learning to achieve unbiased loss estimation, which is free of misleading training signal. We then utilize reweighting mechanism to compensate for the imbalance between positive and negative samples. To further close the performance gap caused by poor quality annotation, we integrate the supervision provided by the automatic annotation tool Medical Concept Annotation Toolkit which can ease the heavy burden of manual validation.
RESULTS: Our benchmarking results show that positive-unlabeled learning with reweighting outperforms competitive baseline methods over a range of missing label ratios. Integrating supervision provided by annotation tool further boosted the performance.
DISCUSSION: Considering the annotation noise and severe imbalance, unbiased loss estimation and reweighting mechanism are both important for learning from undercoded clinical records. Unbiased loss requires the estimation of false negative ratios and estimation through trained models is practical and competitive.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of positive-unlabeled learning with reweighting and supervision provided by the annotation tool is a promising solution to learn from undercoded clinical records.",0.10197094947912691,other,Unknown

METHODS: Similar to last year's edition, a PubMed search of 2021 scientific publications on PHEI has been conducted. The resulting references were reviewed by the two section editors. Then, 11 candidate best papers were selected from the initial 782 references. These papers were then peer-reviewed by selected external reviewers. They included at least two senior researchers, to allow the Editorial Committee of the 2022 IMIA Yearbook edition to make an informed decision for selecting the best papers of the PHEI section.
RESULTS: Among the 782 references retrieved from PubMed, two were selected as the best papers. The first best paper reports a study which performed a comprehensive comparison of traditional statistical approaches (e.g., Cox Proportional Hazards models) vs. machine learning techniques in a large, real-world dataset for predicting breast cancer survival, with a focus on explainability. The second paper describes the engineering of deep learning models to establish associations between ocular features and major hepatobiliary diseases and to advance automated screening and identification of hepatobiliary diseases from ocular images.
CONCLUSION: Overall, from this year edition, we observed that the number of studies related to PHEI has decreased. The findings of the two studies selected as best papers on the topic suggest that a significant effort is still being made by the community to compare traditional learning methods with deep learning methods.

We also investigated whether energy intake adjustment is adequate for deep learning algorithms. We constructed a deep neural network (DNN) in which the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each hidden layer are experimentally selected, and we trained the DNN to diagnose hypertension using the dataset while varying the energy intake adjustment method in four ways. For comparison, we trained a decision tree in the same way. Experimental results showed that the DNN performs better than the decision tree in all aspects, such as having higher sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and accuracy. In addition, we found that unlike general machine learning algorithms, including the decision tree, the DNNs perform best when energy intake is not adjusted.

AIMS: We developed a 3D-HDAM deep learning algorithm to evaluate for dyssynergia.
METHODS: Spatial-temporal data were extracted from consecutive 3D-HDAM studies performed between 2018 and 2020 at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health. The technical procedure and gold standard definition of dyssynergia were based on the London consensus, adapted to the needs of 3D-HDAM technology. Three machine learning models were generated: (1) traditional machine learning informed by conventional anorectal function metrics, (2) deep learning, and (3) a hybrid approach. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using bootstrap sampling to calculate area-under-the-curve (AUC). To evaluate overfitting, models were validated by adding 502 simulated defecation maneuvers with diagnostic ambiguity.
RESULTS: 302 3D-HDAM studies representing 1208 simulated defecation maneuvers were included (average age 55.2 years; 80.5% women). The deep learning model had comparable diagnostic accuracy [AUC 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.89-0.93)] to traditional [AUC 0.93(0.92-0.95)] and hybrid [AUC 0.96(0.94-0.97)] predictive models in training cohorts. However, the deep learning model handled ambiguous tests more cautiously than other models; the deep learning model was more likely to designate an ambiguous test as inconclusive [odds ratio 4.21(2.78-6.38)] versus traditional/hybrid approaches.

In managed settings, deep learning-based models and especially convolutional deep models have shown promise in electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but there is a lack of high-performing models for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in real-world scenarios. We aimed to train and validate a deep learning model using ECGs to predict myocardial infarction in real-world emergency department patients. We studied emergency department patients in the Stockholm region between 2007 and 2016 that had an ECG obtained because of their presenting complaint. We developed a deep neural network based on convolutional layers similar to a residual network. Inputs to the model were ECG tracing, age, and sex; and outputs were the probabilities of three mutually exclusive classes: non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and control status, as registered in the SWEDEHEART and other registries. We used an ensemble of five models. Among 492,226 ECGs in 214,250 patients, 5,416 were recorded with an NSTEMI, 1,818 a STEMI, and 485,207 without a myocardial infarction.

The model obtained a similar performance in a temporally separated test set of the study sample, and achieved a C-statistic of 0.985 and a Brier score of 0.002 in discriminating STEMIs from controls in an external test set. We developed and validated a deep learning model with excellent performance in discriminating between control, STEMI, and NSTEMI on the presenting ECG of a real-world sample of the important population of all-comers to the emergency department.

It is a major disease that causes annual epidemics and occasionally, pandemics. Given that influenza primarily infects the upper respiratory system, it may be possible to diagnose influenza infection by applying deep learning to pharyngeal images.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a deep learning model to diagnose influenza infection using pharyngeal images and clinical information.
METHODS: We recruited patients who visited clinics and hospitals because of influenza-like symptoms. In the training stage, we developed a diagnostic prediction artificial intelligence (AI) model based on deep learning to predict polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed influenza from pharyngeal images and clinical information. In the validation stage, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the AI model. In additional analysis, we compared the diagnostic performance of the AI model with that of 3 physicians and interpreted the AI model using importance heat maps.
RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 7831 patients at 64 hospitals between November 1, 2019, and January 21, 2020, in the training stage and 659 patients (including 196 patients with PCR-confirmed influenza) at 11 hospitals between January 25, 2020, and March 13, 2020, in the validation stage.

For areas with limited testing capacity, wastewater surveillance can provide information on the disease dynamic at a community level. A predictive model is a key to generating quantitative estimates of the infected population. Modeling longitudinal wastewater data can be challenging as biomarkers in wastewater are susceptible to variations caused by multiple factors associated with the wastewater matrix and the sewersheds characteristics. As WBE is an emerging trend, the model should be able to address the uncertainties of wastewater from different sewersheds. We proposed exploiting machine learning and deep learning techniques, which are supported by the growing WBE data. In this article, we reviewed the existing predictive models, among which the emerging machine learning/deep learning models showed great potential. However, most models are built for individual sewersheds with few features extracted from the wastewater. To fulfill the research gap, we compared different time-series and non-time-series models for their short-term predictive performance of COVID-19 cases in 9 diverse sewersheds. The time-series models, long short-term memory (LSTM) and Prophet, outcompeted the non-time-series models. Besides viral (SARS-CoV-2) loads and location identity, domain-specific features like biochemical parameters of wastewater, geographical parameters of the sewersheds, and some socioeconomic parameters of the communities can contribute to the models. With proper feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, we believe machine learning models like LSTM can be a feasible solution for the COVID-19 trend prediction via WBE. Overall, this is a proof-of-concept study on the application of machine learning in COVID-19 WBE.

Anthropometric features of the human body, such as the body mass index (BMI), influences the walk patterns of individuals. In addition to the BMI, uneven walking surfaces may cause variations in the usual walk patterns of an individual that will potentially increase the individual's risk of falling. The objective of this study was to statistically evaluate the variations in the walk patterns of individuals belonging to two BMI groups across a wide range of walking surfaces and to investigate whether a deep learning method could classify the BMI-specific walk patterns with similar variations. Data collected by wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors attached to individuals with two different BMI were collected while walking on real-world surfaces. In addition to traditional statistical analysis tools, an advanced deep learning-based neural network was used to evaluate and classify the BMI-specific walk patterns. The walk patterns of overweight/obese individuals showed a greater correlation with the corresponding walking surfaces than the normal-weight population. The results were supported by the deep learning method, which was able to classify the walk patterns of overweight/obese (94.8 ± 4.5%) individuals more accurately than those of normal-weight (59.4 ± 23.7%) individuals. The results suggest that application of the deep learning method is more suitable for recognizing the walk patterns of overweight/obese population than those of normal-weight individuals.

METHODS: A neural network was constructed with a total of 4000 variables. Clinical, surgical, and pathological data of patients who underwent radical gastrectomy at our institute were collected to maintain a deep learning model. We optimized the parameters of the neural network to diagnose whether these patients would develop complications after gastrectomy or not.
RESULTS: Seventy percent of the data was used to optimize the neural network parameters, and the rest was used to validate the model. A model that maximized the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for validation of the data was extracted.

By utilizing the large-scale Electronic Health Record data found in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, we have developed an automated, personalized risk prediction model to support the clinical decision-making process for localized prostate cancer patients. This method combines the representative power of deep learning and the analytical interpretability of parametric regression models and can implement both time-dependent and static input data. To collect a comprehensive evaluation of model performances, we calculate time-dependent C-statistics [Formula: see text] over 2-, 5-, and 10-year time horizons using either a composite outcome or prostate cancer mortality as the target event. The composite outcome combines the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test, metastasis, and prostate cancer mortality. Our longitudinal model Recurrent Deep Survival Machine (RDSM) achieved [Formula: see text] 0.85 (0.83), 0.80 (0.83), and 0.76 (0.81), while the cross-sectional model Deep Survival Machine (DSM) attained [Formula: see text] 0.85 (0.82), 0.80 (0.82), and 0.76 (0.79) for the 2-, 5-, and 10-year composite (mortality) outcomes, respectively. In addition to estimating the survival probability, our method can quantify the uncertainty associated with the prediction. The uncertainty scores show a consistent correlation with the prediction accuracy. We find PSA and prostate cancer stage information are the most important indicators in risk prediction. Our work demonstrates the utility of the data-driven machine learning model in prostate cancer risk prediction, which can play a critical role in the clinical decision system.",0.15311666240042957,other,Unknown

However, the analysis of medical data remains challenging due to the mixed nature of the data, the incompleteness of many records, and the high level of noise. This paper proposes an improved neural network DBN-LSTM that combines a deep belief network (DBN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The subset of feature attributes processed by CFS-EGA is used for training, and the optimal selection test of the number of hidden layers is performed on the upper DBN in the process of training DBN-LSTM.

Construct the DNN, CNN, and long short-term memory (LSTM) network for comparative analysis with DBN-LSTM.

The aim of this study was to develop and compare deep learning models that predict rare but devastating postoperative complications after abdominal wall reconstruction.
METHODS: A prospectively maintained institutional database was used to identify abdominal wall reconstruction patients with preoperative computed tomography scans. Conventional deep learning models were developed using an 8-layer convolutional neural network and a 2-class training system (ie, learns negative and positive outcomes). Conventional deep learning models were compared to deep learning models that were developed using a generative adversarial network anomaly framework, which uses image augmentation and anomaly detection. The primary outcomes were receiver operating characteristic values for predicting mesh infection and pulmonary failure.
RESULTS: Computed tomography scans from 510 patients were used with a total of 10,004 images. Mesh infection and pulmonary failure occurred in 3.7% and 5.6% of patients, respectively. The conventional deep learning models were less effective than generative adversarial network anomaly for predicting mesh infection (receiver operating characteristic 0.61 vs 0.73, P < .01) and pulmonary failure (receiver operating characteristic 0.59 vs 0.70, P < .01). Although the conventional deep learning models had higher accuracies/specificities for predicting mesh infection (0.93 vs 0.78, P < .01/.96 vs .78, P < .01) and pulmonary failure (0.88 vs 0.68, P < .01/.92 vs .67, P < .01), they were substantially compromised by decreased model sensitivity (0.25 vs 0.68, P < .01/.27 vs .73, P < .01).

OBJECTIVE: Due to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) popularity, it is important to predict postoperative complications, unfavorable 90-day readmissions, and two-year reoperations to improve surgical decision-making, prognostication, and planning.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Machine learning has been applied to predict postoperative complications for ACDF; however, studies were limited by sample size and model type. These studies achieved ≤0.70 area under the curve (AUC). Further approaches, not limited to ACDF, focused on specific complication types and resulted in AUC between 0.70 and 0.76.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database and Medicare Supplement were queried from 2007 to 2016 to identify adult patients who underwent an ACDF procedure (N=176,816). Traditional machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, and support vector machines, were compared with deep neural networks to predict: 90-day postoperative complications, 90-day readmission, and two-year reoperation. We further generated random deep learning model architectures and trained them on the 90-day complication task to approximate an upper bound. Last, using deep learning, we investigated the importance of each input variable for the prediction of 90-day postoperative complications in ACDF.
RESULTS: For the prediction of 90-day complication, 90-day readmission, and two-year reoperation, the deep neural network-based models achieved AUC of 0.832, 0.713, and 0.671. Logistic regression achieved AUCs of 0.820, 0.712, and 0.671. Support vector machine approaches were significantly lower. The upper bound of deep learning performance was approximated as 0.832. Myelopathy, age, human immunodeficiency virus, previous myocardial infarctions, obesity, and documentary weakness were found to be the strongest variable to predict 90-day postoperative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The deep neural network may be used to predict complications for clinical applications after multicenter validation. The results suggest limited added knowledge exists in interactions between the input variables used for this task. Future work should identify novel variables to increase predictive power.",0.1714559932445997,other,"logistic regression, Logistic regression, Support vector machine"

The dataset used in this study contained patients who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and chest radiography at six hospitals between 2010 and 2021. We trained the deep learning model through ensemble learning of chest X-rays, age, and sex to predict BMD using regression and T-score for multiclass classification. We assessed the following two metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model: (1) correlation between the predicted and true BMDs and (2) consistency in the T-score between the predicted class and true class. The correlation coefficients for BMD prediction were hip = 0.75 and lumbar spine = 0.63. The areas under the curves for the T-score predictions of normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis diagnoses were 0.89, 0.70, and 0.84, respectively.

Although promising, training these deep learning models typically requires a large amount of labeled data, and labeled medical data are often very difficult and expensive to obtain.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a self-training deep neural network (DNN) model for early prediction of cognitive deficits at 2 years of corrected age in very preterm infants (gestational age ≤32 weeks) using both labeled and unlabeled brain functional connectome data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected brain functional connectome data from 343 very preterm infants at a mean (standard deviation) postmenstrual age of 42.7 (2.5) weeks, among whom 103 children had a cognitive assessment at 2 years (i.e. labeled data), and the remaining 240 children had not received 2-year assessments at the time this study was conducted (i.e. unlabeled data). To develop a self-training DNN model, we built an initial student model using labeled brain functional connectome data. Then, we applied the trained model as a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled brain functional connectome data. Next, we combined labeled and pseudo-labeled data to train a new student model. We iterated this procedure to obtain the best student model for the early prediction task in very preterm infants.
RESULTS: In our cross-validation experiments, the proposed self-training DNN model achieved an accuracy of 71.0%, a specificity of 71.5%, a sensitivity of 70.4% and an area under the curve of 0.75, significantly outperforming transfer learning models through pre-training approaches.

However, the segmentation of these organs is required beforehand, which is time consuming, particularly on such a large scale.
METHODS: We introduce AbdomentNet, a deep neural network for the automated segmentation of abdominal organs on two-point Dixon MRI scans. A pre-processing pipeline enables to process MRI scans from different imaging studies, namely the German National Cohort, UK Biobank, and Kohorte im Raum Augsburg. We chose a total of 61 MRI scans across the three studies for training an ensemble of segmentation networks, which segment eight abdominal organs. Our network presents a novel combination of octave convolutions and squeeze and excitation layers, as well as training with stochastic weight averaging.
RESULTS: Our experiments demonstrate that it is beneficial to combine data from different imaging studies to train deep neural networks in contrast to training separate networks. Combining the water and opposed-phase contrasts of the Dixon sequence as input channels, yields the highest segmentation accuracy, compared to single contrast inputs. The mean Dice similarity coefficient is above 0.9 for larger organs liver, spleen, and kidneys, and 0.71 and 0.74 for gallbladder and pancreas, respectively.

Several prognostic models have been created utilizing multivariate Cox regression or binary classification-based machine learning approaches to predict the 3- and 5-year survival of patients with chondrosarcoma, but few studies have investigated the results of combining deep learning with time-to-event prediction. Compared with simplifying the prediction as a binary classification problem, modeling the probability of an event as a function of time by combining it with deep learning can provide better accuracy and flexibility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with the diagnosis of chondrosarcoma between 2000 and 2018 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. Three algorithms-two based on neural networks (DeepSurv, neural multi-task logistic regression [NMTLR]) and one on ensemble learning (random survival forest [RSF])-were selected for training. Meanwhile, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model was also constructed for comparison. The dataset was randomly divided into training and testing datasets at a ratio of 7:3. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted through a 1000-repeated random search with 5-fold cross-validation on the training dataset. The model performance was assessed using the concordance index (C-index), Brier score, and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). The accuracy of predicting 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year survival was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), calibration curves, and the area under the ROC curves (AUC).
RESULTS: A total of 3145 patients were finally enrolled in our study. The mean age at diagnosis was 52 ± 18 years, 1662 of the 3145 patients were male (53%), and mean survival time was 83 ± 67 months. Two deep learning models outperformed the RSF and classical CoxPH models, with the C-index on test datasets achieving values of 0.832 (DeepSurv) and 0.821 (NMTLR). The DeepSurv model produced better accuracy and calibrated survival estimates in predicting 1-, 3- 5- and 10-year survival (AUC:0.895-0.937). We deployed the DeepSurv model as a web application for use in clinical practice; it can be accessed through https://share.streamlit.io/whuh-ml/chondrosarcoma/Predict/app.py.

Clearly, the COVID-19 data of a particular provincial region can be easily modelled as a time-series. However, predicting the future COVID-19 infections in a particular region is quite challenging when the availability of COVID-19 dataset of the province is of little quantity. Accordingly, ML models when deployed for such tasks usually results in low infection prediction accuracy. To overcome such issues of low variance and high bias in a model due to data scarcity, multi-source transfer learning (MSTL) along with deep learning may be quite useful and effective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel technique based on multi-source deep transfer learning (MSDTL) to efficiently forecast the future COVID-19 infections in the provinces with insufficient COVID-19 data. The proposed approach is a novel contribution as it considers the fact that future COVID-19 transmission in a region also depends on its population density and economic conditions (GDP) for accurate forecasting of the infections to tackle the pandemic efficiently. The importance of this feature selection is experimentally proved in this paper. Our proposed approach employs the well-known recurrent neural network architecture, the Long-short term memory (LSTM), a popular deep-learning model for history-dependent tasks. A comparative analysis has been performed with existing state-of-art algorithms to portray the efficiency of LSTM. Thus, formation of MSDTL approach enhances the predictive precision capability of the LSTM. We evaluate the proposed methodology over the COVID-19 dataset from sixty-two provinces belonging to different nations. We then empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using two different evaluation metrics, viz. The mean absolute percentage error and the coefficient of determination. We show that our proposed MSDTL based approach is better in terms of the accuracy of the future infection prediction, and produces improvements up to 96% over its without-TL counterpart.",0.12232697994997781,other,LSTM

METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we developed and validated a deep learning survival model using consecutive cases of newly diagnosed stage I to IV esophageal cancer between January 2004 and December 2015 in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The model was externally validated in an independent cohort from Fujian Provincial Hospital. The C statistic was used to compare the performance of the deep learning survival model and TNM staging system. Two other deep learning risk prediction models were trained for treatment recommendations. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare survival between the population that followed the recommended therapy and those who did not.
RESULTS: A total of 9069 patients were included in this study. The deep learning network showed more promising results in predicting esophageal cancer-specific survival than the TNM stage in the internal test dataset (C-index=0.753 vs. 0.638) and external validation dataset (C-index=0.687 vs. 0.643). The population who received the recommended treatments had superior survival compared to those who did not, based on the internal test dataset (hazard ratio, 0.753; 95% CI, 0.556-0.987; P=0.042) and the external validation dataset (hazard ratio, 0.633; 95% CI, 0.459-0.834; P=0.0003).

METHODS: In this large population-based study, we developed and validated a deep learning survival neural network using pathologically diagnosed patients with LSCC from the SEER database between January 2010 and December 2018. Totally 13 variables were included in this network, including patients baseline characteristics, stage, grade, site, tumor extension and treatment details. Based on the total risk score derived from this algorithm, a three-knot restricted cubic spline was plotted to exhibit the difference of survival benefits from two treatment modalities.
RESULTS: Totally 6316 patients with LSCC were included in the study, of which 4237 cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 were selected as the development cohort, and the rest (2079 cases diagnosed from 2016 to 2018) were the validation cohort. A state-of-the-art deep learning-based model based on 23 features (i.e., 13 variables) was generated, which showed more superior performance in the prediction of overall survival (OS) than the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging system (C-index for DeepSurv vs TNM staging = 0.71; 95% CI 0.69-0.74 vs 0.61; 95% CI 0.60-0.63). Interestingly, a significantly nonlinear association between total risk score and treatment effectiveness was observed. When the total risk score ranges 0.1-1.5, surgical treatment brought more survival benefits than nonsurgical one for LSCC patients, especially in 70.5% of patients staged III-IV.
CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning-based model shows more potential benefits in survival estimation for patients with LSCC, which may potentially serve as an auxiliary approach to provide reliable treatment recommendations.",0.15309180702539577,other,Unknown

This study aimed to perform deep learning and machine learning while using text mining to identify patients with suicide attempts and to compare their effectiveness.
METHODS: A total of 13,100 patients with mood disorders were selected. Two traditional text mining methods, logistic regression and Support vector machine (SVM), and one deep learning model (Convolutional neural network, CNN) were adopted to perform overall analysis and gender-specific subgroup analysis of patients to identify suicide attempts. The classification effectiveness of these models was evaluated by accuracy, F1-value, precision, recall, and the area under Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC).
RESULTS: CNN's results were greater than the other two for all indicators except recall which was slightly smaller than SVM in male subgroup analysis. The accuracy values of the CNN were 98.4 %, 98.2 %, and 98.5 % in the overall analysis and the subgroup analysis for males and females, respectively. The results of McNemar's test showed that CNN and SVM models' predictions were statistically different from the logistic regression model's predictions in the overall analysis and the subgroup analysis for females (P < 0.050).
LIMITATIONS: A fixed number of features were selected based on document frequency to train models; this was a single-site study.

There are limited studies on estimating the bleeding risk after ESD using an artificial intelligence system.
AIM: To derivate and verify the performance of the deep learning model and the clinical model for predicting bleeding risk after ESD in EGC patients.
METHODS: Patients with EGC who underwent ESD between January 2010 and June 2020 at the Samsung Medical Center were enrolled, and post-ESD bleeding (PEB) was investigated retrospectively. We split the entire cohort into a development set (80%) and a validation set (20%). The deep learning and clinical model were built on the development set and tested in the validation set.

Deep learning analysis of electrocardiography (ECG) may be useful in detecting aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation (AR), and mitral regurgitation (MR).
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop ECG deep learning algorithms to identify moderate or severe AS, AR, and MR alone and in combination.
METHODS: A total of 77,163 patients undergoing ECG within 1 year before echocardiography from 2005-2021 were identified and split into train (n = 43,165), validation (n = 12,950), and test sets (n = 21,048; 7.8% with any of AS, AR, or MR). Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AU-ROC) and precision-recall curves. Outside validation was conducted on an independent data set. Test accuracy was modeled using different disease prevalence levels to simulate screening efficacy using the deep learning model.
RESULTS: The deep learning algorithm model accuracy was as follows: AS (AU-ROC: 0.88), AR (AU-ROC: 0.77), MR (AU-ROC: 0.83), and any of AS, AR, or MR (AU-ROC: 0.84; sensitivity 78%, specificity 73%) with similar accuracy in external validation. In screening program modeling, test characteristics were dependent on underlying prevalence and selected sensitivity levels.

A prediction model that combines multiple features to assess contamination risks was established in the hope of supporting healthcare workers worldwide in triaging patients, particularly in situations with limited health care resources. Furthermore, a lack of diagnosis kits and asymptomatic cases can lead to missed or delayed diagnoses, exposing visitors, medical staff, and patients to 2019-nCoV contamination. Non-clinical techniques including data mining, expert systems, machine learning, and other artificial intelligence technologies have a crucial role to play in containment and diagnosis in the COVID-19 outbreak. This study developed Enhanced Gravitational Search Optimization with a Hybrid Deep Learning Model (EGSO-HDLM) for COVID-19 diagnoses using epidemiology data. The major aim of designing the EGSO-HDLM model was the identification and classification of COVID-19 using epidemiology data. In order to examine the epidemiology data, the EGSO-HDLM model employed a hybrid convolutional neural network with a gated recurrent unit based fusion (HCNN-GRUF) model. In addition, the hyperparameter optimization of the HCNN-GRUF model was improved by the use of the EGSO algorithm, which was derived by including the concepts of cat map and the traditional GSO algorithm. The design of the EGSO algorithm helps in reducing the ergodic problem, avoiding premature convergence, and enhancing algorithm efficiency. To demonstrate the better performance of the EGSO-HDLM model, experimental validation on a benchmark dataset was performed. The simulation results ensured the enhanced performance of the EGSO-HDLM model over recent approaches.",0.10914136931145126,computer vision,Unknown

We compared the accuracy of a deep learning risk score derived from the patient's prior mammogram to traditional risk scores to prospectively identify patients with cancer in a cohort due for screening.
METHODS: We collected data on 119 139 bilateral screening mammograms in 57 617 consecutive patients screened at 5 facilities between September 18, 2017, and February 1, 2021. Patient demographics were retrieved from electronic medical records, cancer outcomes determined through regional tumor registry linkage, and comparisons made across risk models using Wilcoxon and Pearson χ2 2-sided tests. Deep learning, Tyrer-Cuzick, and National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (NCI BCRAT) risk models were compared with respect to performance metrics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: Cancers detected per thousand patients screened were higher in patients at increased risk by the deep learning model (8.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.9 to 9.4) compared with Tyrer-Cuzick (4.4, 95% CI = 3.9 to 4.9) and NCI BCRAT (3.8, 95% CI = 3.3 to 4.3) models (P &lt; .001).

We hypothesized that these features would predict CKD progression better than clinical characteristics such as nadir creatinine alone.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of boys with PUV treated at two pediatric health systems from 1990 to 2021. Features of kidneys were extracted from initial postnatal kidney ultrasound images using a deep learning model. Three time-to-event prediction models were built using random survival forests. The Imaging Model included deep learning imaging features, the Clinical Model included clinical data, and the Ensemble Model combined imaging features and clinical data. Separate models were built to include time-dependent clinical data that were available at 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years.
RESULTS: Two-hundred and twenty-five patients were included in the analysis. All models performed well with C-indices of 0.7 or greater. The Clinical Model outperformed the Imaging Model at all time points with nadir creatinine driving the performance of the Clinical Model. Combining the 6-month Imaging Model (C-index 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6, 0.79) with the 6-month Clinical Model (C-index 0.79; 95% CI 0.71, 0.86) resulted in a 6-month Ensemble Model that performed better (C-index 0.82; 95% CI 0.77, 0.88) than either model alone.

With recent advances in computer technology and the availability of a wide variety of health data, machine learning has rapidly developed and been applied in medical research. Currently, there are three types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. In medical research, supervised learning is commonly used for diagnoses and prognoses, while unsupervised learning is used for phenotyping a disease, and reinforcement learning for maximizing favorable results, such as optimization of total patients' waiting time in the emergency department. The present article focuses on the concept and application of supervised learning in medicine, the most commonly used machine learning approach in medicine, and provides a brief explanation of four algorithms widely used for prediction (random forests, gradient-boosted decision tree, support vector machine, and neural network). Among these algorithms, the neural network has further developed into deep learning algorithms to solve more complex tasks. Along with simple classification problems, deep learning is commonly used to process medical imaging, such as retinal fundus photographs for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.

METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 847 patients with treatment-naive proximal ureteral calculi who received FURL or PCNL. All participants were preoperatively conducted non-contrast computed tomography scans, and relevant clinical information was meanwhile collected. After propensity score matching, the radiomics model was established to predict the onset of sepsis. A deep learning model was also adapted to further improve the prediction accuracy. Performance of these trained models was verified in another independent external validation set including 40 cases of ureteral calculi patients.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of sepsis after FURL or PCNL was 5.9%. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis revealed 26 predictive variables, with an overall AUC of 0.881 (95% CI, 0.813-0.931) and an AUC of 0.783 (95% CI, 0.766-0.801) in external validation cohort. Judicious adaption of a deep neural network (DNN) model to our dataset improved the AUC to 0.920 (95% CI, 0.906-0.933) in the internal validation. To eliminate the overfitting, external validation was carried out for DNN model (AUC = 0.874 (95% CI, 0.858-0.891)).

Epub 2022 Jun 13.,Bhattacharya I,Med Phys,2022,2022/05/28,PMC9543295,,10.1002/mp.15777,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer remains the second deadliest cancer for American men despite clinical advancements. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the most sensitive non-invasive imaging modality that enables visualization, detection, and localization of prostate cancer, and is increasingly used to guide targeted biopsies for prostate cancer diagnosis. However, its utility remains limited due to high rates of false positives and false negatives as well as low inter-reader agreements.
PURPOSE: Machine learning methods to detect and localize cancer on prostate MRI can help standardize radiologist interpretations. However, existing machine learning methods vary not only in model architecture, but also in the ground truth labeling strategies used for model training. We compare different labeling strategies and the effects they have on the performance of different machine learning models for prostate cancer detection on MRI.
METHODS: Four different deep learning models (SPCNet, U-Net, branched U-Net, and DeepLabv3+) were trained to detect prostate cancer on MRI using 75 patients with radical prostatectomy, and evaluated using 40 patients with radical prostatectomy and 275 patients with targeted biopsy. Each deep learning model was trained with four different label types: pathology-confirmed radiologist labels, pathologist labels on whole-mount histopathology images, and lesion-level and pixel-level digital pathologist labels (previously validated deep learning algorithm on histopathology images to predict pixel-level Gleason patterns) on whole-mount histopathology images. The pathologist and digital pathologist labels (collectively referred to as pathology labels) were mapped onto pre-operative MRI using an automated MRI-histopathology registration platform.
RESULTS: Radiologist labels missed cancers (ROC-AUC: 0.75-0.84), had lower lesion volumes (~68% of pathology lesions), and lower Dice overlaps (0.24-0.28) when compared with pathology labels. Consequently, machine learning models trained with radiologist labels also showed inferior performance compared to models trained with pathology labels. Digital pathologist labels showed high concordance with pathologist labels of cancer (lesion ROC-AUC: 0.97-1, lesion Dice: 0.75-0.93). Machine learning models trained with digital pathologist labels had the highest lesion detection rates in the radical prostatectomy cohort (aggressive lesion ROC-AUC: 0.91-0.94), and had generalizable and comparable performance to pathologist label-trained-models in the targeted biopsy cohort (aggressive lesion ROC-AUC: 0.87-0.88), irrespective of the deep learning architecture. Moreover, machine learning models trained with pixel-level digital pathologist labels were able to selectively identify aggressive and indolent cancer components in mixed lesions on MRI, which is not possible with any human-annotated label type.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models for prostate MRI interpretation that are trained with digital pathologist labels showed higher or comparable performance with pathologist label-trained models in both radical prostatectomy and targeted biopsy cohort. Digital pathologist labels can reduce challenges associated with human annotations, including labor, time, inter- and intra-reader variability, and can help bridge the gap between prostate radiology and pathology by enabling the training of reliable machine learning models to detect and localize prostate cancer on MRI.",0.12744881987902493,computer vision,Unknown

The heterogeneous spread of the pandemic within EU regions elicited a wide range of policies, such as school closure, transport restrictions, etc. However, the implementation of these interventions is not accompanied by the implementation of quantitative methods, which would indicate their effectiveness. As a result, the efficacy of such policies on reducing the spread of the virus varies significantly. This paper investigates the effectiveness of using deep learning paradigms to accurately model the spread of COVID-19. The deep learning approaches proposed in this paper are able to effectively map the temporal evolution of a COVID-19 outbreak, while simultaneously taking into account policy interventions directly into the modelling process. Thus, our approach facilitates data-driven decision making by utilizing previous knowledge to train models that predict not only the spread of COVID-19, but also the effect of specific policy measures on minimizing this spread. Global models at the EU level are proposed, which can be successfully applied at the national level. These models use various inputs in order to successfully model the spatio-temporal variability of the phenomenon and obtain generalization abilities.

In this paper, we propose a multi-model PSN that considers heterogeneous static and dynamic data. The combination of deep learning models and PSN allows ample clinical evidence and information extraction against which similar patients can be compared. We use the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to analyze the contextual data and generate word embedding, where semantic features are captured using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Dynamic data are analyzed using a long-short-term-memory (LSTM)-based autoencoder, which reduces data dimensionality and preserves the temporal features of the data.

The proposed phase of the framework was evaluated on the test dataset and yielded remarkable results and achieved a detection sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.99, 0.986, and 0.988, for the first phase and 0.997, 0.9976, and 0.997 for the second phase, respectively. In all cases, the whole framework was able to successfully classify COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases from CT scans and X-ray images.
CONCLUSION: Since the proposed framework was based on two deep learning models that used two radiology modalities, it was able to significantly assist radiologists in detecting COVID-19 in the early stages. The use of models with this feature can be considered as a powerful and reliable tool, compared to the previous models used in the past pandemics.",0.11057998268798383,computer vision,CNN

Epub 2022 May 2.,Yang L,Cancer Med,2022,2022/05/02,PMC9678103,,10.1002/cam4.4782,"BACKGROUND: Accurate prognostic prediction plays a crucial role in the clinical setting. However, the TNM staging system fails to provide satisfactory individual survival prediction for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The performance of the deep learning network for survival prediction in stage III NSCLC has not been explored.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a deep learning-based prognostic system that could achieve better predictive performance than the existing staging system for stage III NSCLC.
METHODS: In this study, a deep survival learning model (DSLM) for stage III NSCLC was developed based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and was independently tested with another external cohort from our institute. DSLM was compared with the Cox proportional hazard (CPH) and random survival forest (RSF) models. A new prognostic system for stage III NSCLC was also proposed based on the established deep learning model.
RESULTS: The study included 16,613 patients with stage III NSCLC from the SEER database. DSLM showed the best performance in survival prediction, with a C-index of 0.725 in the validation set, followed by RSF (0.688) and CPH (0.683). DSLM also showed C-indices of 0.719 and 0.665 in the internal and real-world external testing datasets, respectively. In addition, the new prognostic system based on DSLM (AUROC = 0.744) showed better performance than the TNM staging system (AUROC = 0.561).
CONCLUSION: In this study, a new, integrated deep learning-based prognostic model was developed and evaluated for stage III NSCLC. This novel approach may be valuable in improving patient stratification and potentially provide meaningful prognostic information that contributes to personalized therapy.",0.15930863460473627,other,Unknown

Recent studies on the prediction modeling for stroke focused mostly on clinical characteristics and radiological scores available at baseline. Radiological images are composed of millions of voxels, and a lot of information can be lost when representing this information by a single value. Therefore, in this study we aimed at developing prediction models that take into account the whole imaging data combined with clinical data available at baseline.
METHODS: We included 3,279 patients from the MR CLEAN Registry; a prospective, observational, multicenter registry of patients with ischemic stroke treated with EVT. We developed two approaches to combine the imaging data with the clinical data. The first approach was based on radiomics features, extracted from 70 atlas regions combined with the clinical data to train machine learning models. For the second approach, we trained 3D deep learning models using the whole images and the clinical data. Models trained with the clinical data only were compared with models trained with the combination of clinical and image data. Finally, we explored feature importance plots for the best models and identified many known variables and image features/brain regions that were relevant in the model decision process.
RESULTS: From 3,279 patients included, 1,241 (37%) patients had a good functional outcome [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 2] and 1,954 (60%) patients had good reperfusion [modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) ≥ 2b]. There was no significant improvement by combining the image data to the clinical data for mRS prediction [mean area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.81 vs. 0.80] above using the clinical data only, regardless of the approach used. Regarding predicting reperfusion, there was a significant improvement when image and clinical features were combined (mean AUC of 0.54 vs. 0.61), with the highest AUC obtained by the deep learning approach.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of radiomics and deep learning image features with clinical data significantly improved the prediction of good reperfusion. The visualization of prediction feature importance showed both known and novel clinical and imaging features with predictive values.",0.125530187964113,computer vision,Unknown

In this paper, we presented different prediction models using deep learning methods based on the monthly incidence of Hepatitis through a national public health surveillance system in China mainland.
METHODS: We assessed and compared the performance of three deep learning methods, namely, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) prediction model, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) prediction model, and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) prediction model. The data collected from 2005 to 2018 were used for the training and prediction model, while the data are split via 5-Fold cross-validation. The performance was evaluated based on three metrics: mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
RESULTS: Among the year 2005-2018, 20,924,951 cases and 11,892 deaths were supervised in the system. Hepatitis B (HB) is the most disease-causing incidence and death, and the proportion is greater than 70 percent, while the percentage of the incidence and deaths is decreased much in 2018 compared with 2005. Based on the measured errors and the visualization of the three neural networks, there is no one model predicting the incidence cases that can be completely superior to other models. When predicting the number of incidence cases for HB, the performance ranking of the three models from high to low is LSTM, BPNN, RNN, while it is LSTM, RNN, BPNN for Hepatitis C (HC). while the MAE, MSE and MAPE of the LSTM model for HB, HC are 3.84*10-06, 3.08*10-11, 4.981, 8.84*10-06, 1.98*10-12,5.8519, respectively.

We developed an automatic cardiac structure segmentation pipeline for use in low-dose non-contrast planning CT based on deep learning algorithms for small datasets. Fifty CT scans were retrospectively selected and the whole heart, ventricles and atria were contoured. A two stage deep learning pipeline was trained on 41 non contrast planning CTs, tuned with 3 CT scans and validated on 6 CT scans. In the first stage, An InceptionResNetV2 network was used to identify the slices that contained cardiac structures. The second stage consisted of three deep learning models trained on the images containing cardiac structures to segment the structures. The three deep learning models predicted the segmentations/contours on axial, coronal and sagittal images and are combined to create the final prediction. The final accuracy of the pipeline was quantified on 6 volumes by calculating the Dice similarity coefficient (DC), 95% Hausdorff distance (95% HD) and volume ratios between predicted and ground truth volumes.

Forecasting apnea occurrence ahead in time provides the opportunity to take appropriate actions to control and manage it.
METHODS: A novel framework for forecasting the occurrence of apnea from single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) based on deep recurrent neural networks is proposed. ECG R-peak amplitudes and R-R intervals are extracted and aligned using power spectral analysis, and recurrent deep learning models are developed to extract the most predictive ECG features and forecast the occurrence of apnea.
RESULTS: The performance of the proposed approach was validated in forecasting apnea events up to five minutes in future on a dataset of 70 sleep recordings.

Deep-learning systems have the potential to enhance diabetic retinopathy screenings in these settings, yet prospective studies assessing their usability and performance are scarce.
METHODS: We did a prospective interventional cohort study to evaluate the real-world performance and feasibility of deploying a deep-learning system into the health-care system of Thailand. Patients with diabetes and listed on the national diabetes registry, aged 18 years or older, able to have their fundus photograph taken for at least one eye, and due for screening as per the Thai Ministry of Public Health guidelines were eligible for inclusion. Eligible patients were screened with the deep-learning system at nine primary care sites under Thailand's national diabetic retinopathy screening programme. Patients with a previous diagnosis of diabetic macular oedema, severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or proliferative diabetic retinopathy; previous laser treatment of the retina or retinal surgery; other non-diabetic retinopathy eye disease requiring referral to an ophthalmologist; or inability to have fundus photograph taken of both eyes for any reason were excluded. Deep-learning system-based interpretations of patient fundus images and referral recommendations were provided in real time. As a safety mechanism, regional retina specialists over-read each image. Performance of the deep-learning system (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], and negative predictive value [NPV]) were measured against an adjudicated reference standard, provided by fellowship-trained retina specialists. This study is registered with the Thai national clinical trials registry, TCRT20190902002.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 12, 2018, and March 29, 2020, 7940 patients were screened for inclusion. 7651 (96·3%) patients were eligible for study analysis, and 2412 (31·5%) patients were referred for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular oedema, ungradable images, or low visual acuity. For vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, the deep-learning system had an accuracy of 94·7% (95% CI 93·0-96·2), sensitivity of 91·4% (87·1-95·0), and specificity of 95·4% (94·1-96·7). The retina specialist over-readers had an accuracy of 93·5 (91·7-95·0; p=0·17), a sensitivity of 84·8% (79·4-90·0; p=0·024), and specificity of 95·5% (94·1-96·7; p=0·98). The PPV for the deep-learning system was 79·2 (95% CI 73·8-84·3) compared with 75·6 (69·8-81·1) for the over-readers. The NPV for the deep-learning system was 95·5 (92·8-97·9) compared with 92·4 (89·3-95·5) for the over-readers.
INTERPRETATION: A deep-learning system can deliver real-time diabetic retinopathy detection capability similar to retina specialists in community-based screening settings. Socioenvironmental factors and workflows must be taken into consideration when implementing a deep-learning system within a large-scale screening programme in LMICs.

Now, transforming these huge volumes of data into knowledge is the primary challenge in computational biology. The traditional methods of data analysis have failed to carry out the task. Hence, researchers are turning to machine learning based approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional big data. In machine learning, once a model is trained with a training dataset, it can be applied on a testing dataset which is independent. In current times, deep learning algorithms further promote the application of machine learning in several field of biology including plant virology.
MAIN BODY: Plant viruses have emerged as one of the principal global threats to food security due to their devastating impact on crops and vegetables. The emergence of new viral strains and species help viruses to evade the concurrent preventive methods. According to a survey conducted in 2014, plant viruses are anticipated to cause a global yield loss of more than thirty billion USD per year. In order to design effective, durable and broad-spectrum management protocols, it is very important to understand the mechanistic details of viral pathogenesis. The application of machine learning enables precise diagnosis of plant viral diseases at an early stage. Furthermore, the development of several machine learning-guided bioinformatics platforms has primed plant virologists to understand the host-virus interplay better. In addition, machine learning has tremendous potential in deciphering the pattern of plant virus evolution and emergence as well as in developing viable control options.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering a significant progress in the application of machine learning in understanding plant virology, this review highlights an introductory note on machine learning and comprehensively discusses the trends and prospects of machine learning in the diagnosis of viral diseases, understanding host-virus interplay and emergence of plant viruses.",0.15406162200094675,other,Unknown

In these settings, accurate patient prognostication is both difficult and essential for high-quality patient care. With the ultimate goal of enhancing TBI triage in LMICs, we aim to develop the first deep learning model to predict outcomes after TBI and compare its performance with that of less complex algorithms.
METHODS: TBI patients' data were prospectively collected in Kampala, Uganda, from 2016 to 2020. To predict good versus poor outcome at hospital discharge, we created deep neural network, shallow neural network, and elastic-net regularized logistic regression models. Predictors included 13 easily acquirable clinical variables. We assessed model performance with 5-fold cross-validation to calculate areas under both the receiver operating characteristic curve and precision-recall curve (AUPRC), in addition to standardized partial AUPRC to focus on comparisons at clinically relevant operating points.
RESULTS: We included 2164 patients for model training, of which 12% had poor outcomes. The deep neural network performed best as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.941) and standardized partial AUPRC in region maximizing recall (0.291), whereas the shallow neural network was best by the area under the precision-recall curve (0.770). In several other comparisons, the elastic-net regularized logistic regression was noninferior to the neural networks.
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first use of deep learning for TBI prognostication, with an emphasis on LMICs, where there is great need for decision support to allocate limited resources.

We used this information to establish a model that combined deep learning with a multilayer neural network (the DeepSurv model) for predicting the survival rate of patients with rectal adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: We collected patients with rectal adenocarcinoma in the United States and older than 20 yearswho had been added to the SEER database from 2004 to 2015. We divided these patients into training and test cohortsat a ratio of 7:3. The training cohort was used to develop a seven-layer neural network based on the analysis method established by Katzman and colleagues to construct a DeepSurv prediction model. We then used the C-index and calibration plots to evaluate the prediction performance of the DeepSurv model.
RESULTS: The 49,275 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma included in the study were randomly divided into the training cohort (70%, n = 34,492) and the test cohort (30%, n = 14,783). There were no statistically significant differences in clinical characteristics between the two cohorts (p > 0.05). We applied Cox proportional-hazards regression to the data in the training cohort, which showed that age, sex, marital status, tumor grade, surgery status, and chemotherapy status were significant factors influencing survival (p < 0.05). Using the training cohort to construct the DeepSurv model resulted in a C-index of the model of 0.824, while using the test cohort to verify the DeepSurv model yielded a C-index of 0.821. Thesevalues show that the prediction effect of the DeepSurv model for the test-cohort patients was highly consistent with the prediction resultsfor the training-cohort patients.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The deep learning model for prediction of type 2 diabetes was trained on retinal images from 50,077 UK Biobank participants and tested on 12,185 participants. We evaluated its performance in terms of predicting traditional risk factors (TRFs) and genetic risk for diabetes. Next, we compared the performance of three models in predicting type 2 diabetes using 1) an image-only deep learning algorithm, 2) TRFs, 3) the combination of the algorithm and TRFs. Assessing net reclassification improvement (NRI) allowed quantification of the improvement afforded by adding the algorithm to the TRF model. When predicting TRFs with the deep learning algorithm, the areas under the curve (AUCs) obtained with the validation set for age, sex, and HbA1c status were 0.931 (0.928-0.934), 0.933 (0.929-0.936), and 0.734 (0.715-0.752), respectively. When predicting type 2 diabetes, the AUC of the composite logistic model using non-invasive TRFs was 0.810 (0.790-0.830), and that for the deep learning model using only fundus images was 0.731 (0.707-0.756).

Several pulmonary nodules risk prediction models were developed to solve the problem. This systematic review aimed to compare the quality and accuracy of these models.
METHODS: The keywords ""lung cancer,"" ""lung neoplasms,"" ""lung tumor,"" ""risk,"" ""lung carcinoma"" ""risk,"" ""predict,"" ""assessment,"" and ""nodule"" were used to identify relevant articles published before February 2021. All studies with multivariate risk models developed and validated on human LDCT data were included. Informal publications or studies with incomplete procedures were excluded. Information was extracted from each publication and assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 41 articles and 43 models were included. External validation was performed for 23.2% (10/43) models. Deep learning algorithms were applied in 62.8% (27/43) models; 60.0% (15/25) deep learning based researches compared their algorithms with traditional methods, and received better discrimination. Models based on Asian and Chinese populations were usually built on single-center or small sample retrospective studies, and the majority of the Asian models (12/15, 80.0%) were not validated using external datasets.
CONCLUSION: The existing models showed good discrimination for identifying high-risk pulmonary nodules, but lacked external validation. Deep learning algorithms are increasingly being used with good performance.

Deep learning models applied to rich electronic health records may improve prediction but remain unexplainable hampering their wider use in medical practice. We aimed to develop a deep-learning framework for accurate and yet explainable prediction of 6-month incident heart failure (HF). Using 100,071 patients from longitudinal linked electronic health records across the U.K., we applied a novel Transformer-based risk model using all community and hospital diagnoses and medications contextualized within the age and calendar year for each patient's clinical encounter. Feature importance was investigated with an ablation analysis to compare model performance when alternatively removing features and by comparing the variability of temporal representations. A post-hoc perturbation technique was conducted to propagate the changes in the input to the outcome for feature contribution analyses. Our model achieved 0.93 area under the receiver operator curve and 0.69 area under the precision-recall curve on internal 5-fold cross validation and outperformed existing deep learning models. Ablation analysis indicated medication is important for predicting HF risk, calendar year is more important than chronological age, which was further reinforced by temporal variability analysis. Contribution analyses identified risk factors that are closely related to HF. Many of them were consistent with existing knowledge from clinical and epidemiological research but several new associations were revealed which had not been considered in expert-driven risk prediction models. In conclusion, the results highlight that our deep learning model, in addition high predictive performance, can inform data-driven risk factor identification.",0.19848127749355238,other,Transformer

Machine learning methodologies such as deep neural networks provide a potential avenue for increasing accuracy in GFR estimation. We developed a novel deep learning architecture, a deep and shallow neural network, to estimate GFR (dlGFR for short) and examined its comparative performance with estimated GFR from Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations. The dlGFR model jointly trains a shallow learning model and a deep neural network to enable both linear transformation from input features to a log GFR target, and non-linear feature embedding for stage of kidney function classification. We validate the proposed methods on the data from multiple studies obtained from the NIDDK Central Database Repository. The deep learning model predicted values of GFR within 30% of measured GFR with 88.3% accuracy, compared to the 87.1% and 84.7% of the accuracy achieved by CKD-EPI and MDRD equations (p = 0.051 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively).

Automation by deep learning algorithms would decrease the workload of radiotherapists and technicians considerably. However, the variety of metrics used for the evaluation of deep learning algorithms make the results of many papers difficult to interpret and compare. In this paper, a qualitative evaluation is done on five established metrics to assess whether their values correlate with clinical usability. A total of 377 CT volumes with heart delineations were randomly selected for training and evaluation. A deep learning algorithm was used to predict the contours of the heart. A total of 101 CT slices from the validation set with the predicted contours were shown to three experienced radiologists. They examined each slice independently whether they would accept or adjust the prediction and if there were (small) mistakes. For each slice, the scores of this qualitative evaluation were then compared with the Sørensen-Dice coefficient (DC), the Hausdorff distance (HD), pixel-wise accuracy, sensitivity and precision. The statistical analysis of the qualitative evaluation and metrics showed a significant correlation. Of the slices with a DC over 0.96 (N = 20) or a 95% HD under 5 voxels (N = 25), no slices were rejected by the readers. Contours with lower DC or higher HD were seen in both rejected and accepted contours. Qualitative evaluation shows that it is difficult to use common quantification metrics as indicator for use in clinic.

However, the reported studies were based on blastocyst formation or clinical pregnancy as the end point. To the best of our knowledge, there is no predictive model that uses the outcome of live birth as the predictive end point. Can a deep learning model predict the probability of live birth from time-lapse system?
METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the time-lapse data and live birth outcomes of embryos samples from January 2018 to November 2019. We used the SGD optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.025 and cosine learning rate reduction strategy. The network is randomly initialized and trained for 200 epochs from scratch. The model is quantitively evaluated over a hold-out test and a 5-fold cross-validation by the average area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: The deep learning model was able to predict live birth outcomes from time-lapse images with an AUC of 0.968 in 5-fold stratified cross-validation.
CONCLUSIONS: This research reported a deep learning model that predicts the live birth outcome of a single blastocyst transfer. This efficient model for predicting the outcome of live births can automatically analyze the time-lapse images of the patient's embryos without the need for manual embryo annotation and evaluation, and then give a live birth prediction score for each embryo, and sort the embryos by the predicted value.",0.17027524061676408,computer vision,Unknown

Efficient release of enveloped virions, which promote systemic spread of infection within hosts, requires the VACV protein E2 but the molecular basis of E2 function remains unclear and E2 lacks sequence homology to any well-characterised family of proteins. We solved the crystal structure of VACV E2 to 2.3 Å resolution, revealing that it comprises two domains with novel folds: an N-terminal annular (ring) domain and a C-terminal globular (head) domain. The C-terminal head domain displays weak structural homology with cellular (pseudo)kinases but lacks conserved surface residues or kinase features, suggesting that it is not enzymatically active, and possesses a large surface basic patch that might interact with phosphoinositide lipid headgroups. Recent deep learning methods have revolutionised our ability to predict the three-dimensional structures of proteins from primary sequence alone. VACV E2 is an exemplar 'difficult' viral protein target for structure prediction, being comprised of multiple novel domains and lacking sequence homologues outside Poxviridae. AlphaFold2 nonetheless succeeds in predicting the structures of the head and ring domains with high and moderate accuracy, respectively, allowing accurate inference of multiple structural properties.

However, studies using administrative databases lack information on disease severity, so a risk adjustment method needs to be developed.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and validate deep learning-based prediction models for in-hospital mortality of acute care patients.
METHODS: The main model was developed using only administrative claims data (age, sex, diagnoses, and procedures on the day of admission). We also constructed disease-specific models for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and pneumonia using common severity indices for these diseases. Using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination data from July 2010 to March 2017, we identified 46,665,933 inpatients and divided them into derivation and validation cohorts in a ratio of 95:5. The main model was developed using a 9-layer deep neural network with 4 hidden dense layers that had 1000 nodes and were fully connected to adjacent layers. We evaluated model discrimination ability by an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration ability by calibration plot.
RESULTS: Among the eligible patients, 2,005,035 (4.3%) died. Discrimination and calibration of the models were satisfactory. The AUC of the main model in the validation cohort was 0.954 (95% CI 0.954-0.955). The main model had higher discrimination ability than the disease-specific models.

We aimed to assess whether 1-mm-slice-thickness MRI with deep learning-based reconstruction can better predict cavernous sinus invasion by pituitary adenoma preoperatively and to estimate the depth of invasion and degree of contact in relation to the carotid artery, compared with 3-mm-slice-thickness MRI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-institution, prospective study included 67 consecutive patients (mean age, 53 [SD, 12] years; 28 women), between January and August 2020, who underwent a combined contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging protocol of 1-mm-slice-thickness MRI + deep learning-based reconstruction and 3-mm-slice-thickness MRI. An expert neuroradiologist who was blinded to the imaging protocol determined cavernous sinus invasion using the modified Knosp classification on 1-mm-slice-thickness MRI + deep learning-based reconstruction and 3-mm-slice-thickness MRI, respectively. Reference standards were established by the consensus of radiologic, intraoperative, pathologic, and laboratory findings. The primary end point was the diagnostic performance of each imaging protocol, and the secondary end points included depth of invasion and degree of contact in relation to the carotid artery.
RESULTS: The diagnostic performance of 1-mm-slice-thickness MRI + deep learning-based reconstruction (area under the curve, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69 - 0.89) in predicting cavernous sinus invasion by pituitary adenoma was higher than that of 3-mm-slice-thickness MRI (area under the curve, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.52-0.70; P &lt; .001).

The purpose of this study was to use this information to construct a neural-network model based on deep learning to predict the survival probabilities of patients with conditions that are common in CCUs.
METHOD: We collected information on patients in the United States with five common diseases in CCUs from 2001 to 2012. We randomly divided the patients into a training cohort and a testing cohort at a ratio of 7 : 3 and applied a survival prediction method based on deep learning to predict their survival probability. We compared our model with the Cox proportional-hazards regression (CPH) model and used the concordance indexes (C-indexes), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and calibration plots to evaluate the predictive performance of the model.
RESULTS: The 3,388 CCU patients included in the study were randomly divided into 2,371 in the training cohort and 1,017 in the testing cohort. The stepwise regression results showed that the important factors affecting patient survival were the type of disease, age, race, anion gap, glucose, neutrophils, white blood cells, potassium, creatine kinase, and blood urea nitrogen (P &lt; 0.05). We used the training cohort to construct a deep-learning model, for which the C-index was 0.833, or about 5% higher than that for the CPH model (0.786).

Currently, the quality of a model's uncertainty is evaluated using point-prediction metrics, such as the negative log-likelihood (NLL), expected calibration error (ECE) or the Brier score on held-out data. Marginal coverage of prediction intervals or sets, a well-known concept in the statistical literature, is an intuitive alternative to these metrics but has yet to be systematically studied for many popular uncertainty quantification techniques for deep learning models. With marginal coverage and the complementary notion of the width of a prediction interval, downstream users of deployed machine learning models can better understand uncertainty quantification both on a global dataset level and on a per-sample basis. In this study, we provide the first large-scale evaluation of the empirical frequentist coverage properties of well-known uncertainty quantification techniques on a suite of regression and classification tasks. We find that, in general, some methods do achieve desirable coverage properties on in distribution samples, but that coverage is not maintained on out-of-distribution data.

This study compared deep learning extensions of survival analysis models with Cox proportional hazards models for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in national health administrative datasets.
METHODS: Using individual person linkage of administrative datasets, we constructed a cohort of all New Zealanders aged 30-74 who interacted with public health services during 2012. After excluding people with prior CVD, we developed sex-specific deep learning and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the risk of CVD events within 5 years. Models were compared based on the proportion of explained variance, model calibration and discrimination, and hazard ratios for predictor variables.
RESULTS: First CVD events occurred in 61 927 of 2 164 872 people. Within the reference group, the largest hazard ratios estimated by the deep learning models were for tobacco use in women (2.04, 95% CI: 1.99, 2.10) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute lower respiratory infection in men (1.56, 95% CI: 1.50, 1.62). Other identified predictors (e.g. hypertension, chest pain, diabetes) aligned with current knowledge about CVD risk factors. Deep learning outperformed Cox proportional hazards models on the basis of proportion of explained variance (R2: 0.468 vs 0.425 in women and 0.383 vs 0.348 in men), calibration and discrimination (all P <0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning extensions of survival analysis models can be applied to large health administrative datasets to derive interpretable CVD risk prediction equations that are more accurate than traditional Cox proportional hazards models.",0.20654775540559805,other,Unknown

At the same time, current screening guidelines for venous thromboembolism risk have low sensitivity for CADVT in hospitalized children. This study utilized a multimodal deep learning model to predict CADVT before it occurs.
METHODS: Children who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) between December 2015 and December 2018 and with CVC placement at least 3 days were included. The variables analyzed included demographic characteristics, clinical conditions, laboratory test results, vital signs and medications. A multimodal deep learning (MMDL) model that can handle temporal data using long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) was proposed for this prediction task. Four benchmark machine learning models, logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and a published cutting edge MMDL, were used to compare and evaluate the models with a fivefold cross-validation approach. Accuracy, recall, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and average precision (AP) were used to evaluate the discrimination of each model at three time points (24 h, 48 h and 72 h) before CADVT occurred. Brier score and Spiegelhalter's z test were used measure the calibration of these prediction models.
RESULTS: A total of 1830 patients were included in this study, and approximately 15% developed CADVT. In the CADVT prediction task, the model proposed in this paper significantly outperforms both traditional machine learning models and existing multimodal deep learning models at all 3 time points. It achieved 77% accuracy and 90% recall at 24 h before CADVT was discovered. It can be used to accurately predict the occurrence of CADVT 72 h in advance with an accuracy of greater than 75%, a recall of more than 87%, and an AUC value of 0.82.
CONCLUSION: In this study, a machine learning method was successfully established to predict CADVT in advance. These findings demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI) could provide measures for thromboprophylaxis in a pediatric intensive care setting.",0.13409263506306096,other,"random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, LSTM"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on 2634 radiography sets (5865 images) from 2549 children (1459 boys, 1090 girls; mean age, 8.5 ± 4.5 [SD] years; age range: 0-17 years) referred by the pediatric emergency room for trauma. For each set was recorded whether one or more fractures were found, the number of fractures, and their location found by the senior radiologists and the algorithm. Using the senior radiologist diagnosis as the standard of reference, the diagnostic performance of deep learning algorithm (Rayvolve®) was calculated via three different approaches: a detection approach (presence/absence of a fracture as a binary variable), an enumeration approach (exact number of fractures detected) and a localization approach (focusing on whether the detected fractures were correctly localized). Subgroup analyses were performed according to the presence of a cast or not, age category (0-4 vs. 5-18 years) and anatomical region.
RESULTS: Regarding detection approach, the deep learning algorithm yielded 95.7% sensitivity (95% CI: 94.0-96.9), 91.2% specificity (95% CI: 89.8-92.5) and 92.6% accuracy (95% CI: 91.5-93.6). Regarding enumeration and localization approaches, the deep learning algorithm yielded 94.1% sensitivity (95% CI: 92.1-95.6), 88.8% specificity (95% CI: 87.3-90.2) and 90.4% accuracy (95% CI: 89.2-91.5) for both approaches. Regarding age-related subgroup analyses, the deep learning algorithm yielded greater sensitivity and negative predictive value in the 5-18-years age group than in the 0-4-years age group for the detection approach (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002) and for the enumeration and localization approaches (P = 0.012 and P = 0.028). The high negative predictive value was robust, persisting in all of the subgroup analyses, except for patients with casts (P = 0.001 for the detection approach and P < 0.001 for the enumeration and localization approaches).
CONCLUSION: The Rayvolve® deep learning algorithm is very reliable for detecting fractures in children, especially in those older than 4 years and without cast.",0.18605545071541668,computer vision,Unknown

Clinical notes in longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide opportunities to detect cognitive decline earlier than it is noted in structured EHR fields as formal diagnoses.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a deep learning model to detect evidence of cognitive decline from clinical notes in the EHR.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Notes documented 4 years preceding the initial mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis were extracted from Mass General Brigham's Enterprise Data Warehouse for patients aged 50 years or older and with initial MCI diagnosis during 2019. The study was conducted from March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. Sections of notes for cognitive decline were labeled manually and 2 reference data sets were created. Data set I contained a random sample of 4950 note sections filtered by a list of keywords related to cognitive functions and was used for model training and testing. Data set II contained 2000 randomly selected sections without keyword filtering for assessing whether the model performance was dependent on specific keywords.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A deep learning model and 4 baseline models were developed and their performance was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC).
RESULTS: Data set I represented 1969 patients (1046 [53.1%] women; mean [SD] age, 76.0 [13.3] years). Data set II comprised 1161 patients (619 [53.3%] women; mean [SD] age, 76.5 [10.2] years). With some overlap of patients deleted, the unique population was 2166. Cognitive decline was noted in 1453 sections (29.4%) in data set I and 69 sections (3.45%) in data set II. Compared with the 4 baseline models, the deep learning model achieved the best performance in both data sets, with AUROC of 0.971 (95% CI, 0.967-0.976) and AUPRC of 0.933 (95% CI, 0.921-0.944) for data set I and AUROC of 0.997 (95% CI, 0.994-0.999) and AUPRC of 0.929 (95% CI, 0.870-0.969) for data set II.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this diagnostic study, a deep learning model accurately detected cognitive decline from clinical notes preceding MCI diagnosis and had better performance than keyword-based search and other machine learning models. These results suggest that a deep learning model could be used for earlier detection of cognitive decline in the EHRs.",0.15784743968054157,other,Unknown

We investigated whether novel deep learning survival models can augment ASCVD risk prediction over existing statistical and machine learning approaches.
METHODS: 6814 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) were followed over 16 years to assess incidence of all-cause mortality (mortality) or a composite of major adverse events (MAE). Features were evaluated within the categories of traditional risk factors, inflammatory biomarkers, and imaging markers. Data was split into an internal training/testing (four centers) and external validation (two centers). Both machine learning (COXPH, RSF, and lSVM) and deep learning (nMTLR and DeepSurv) models were evaluated.
RESULTS: In comparison to the COXPH model, DeepSurv significantly improved ASCVD risk prediction for MAE (AUC: 0.82 vs. 0.80, P ≤ 0.001) and mortality (AUC: 0.87 vs. 0.84, P ≤ 0.001) with traditional risk factors alone. Implementing non-categorical NRI, we noted a >40% increase in correct reclassification compared to the COXPH model for both MAE and mortality (P ≤ 0.05). Assessing the relative risk of participants, DeepSurv was the only learning algorithm to develop a significantly improved risk score criteria, which outcompeted COXPH for both MAE (4.22 vs. 3.61, P = 0.043) and mortality (6.81 vs. 5.52, P = 0.044). The addition of inflammatory or imaging biomarkers to traditional risk factors showed minimal/no significant improvement in model prediction.
CONCLUSION: DeepSurv can leverage simple office-based clinical features alone to accurately predict ASCVD risk and cardiovascular outcomes, without the need for additional features, such as inflammatory and imaging biomarkers.",0.13310563642397877,other,Unknown

Sparse learning has been widely used in detecting brain diseases objectively by removing redundant information and retaining monitor valuable biological characteristics from the brain functional connectivity network (BFCN). However, most existing methods ignore the relationship between brain regions in each subject. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a spatial similarity-aware learning (SSL) model to build BFCNs. Specifically, we embrace the spatial relationship between adjacent or bilaterally symmetric brain regions via a smoothing regularization term in the model. We develop a novel fused deep polynomial network (FDPN) model to further learn the powerful information and attempt to solve the problem of curse of dimensionality using BFCN features. In the FDPN model, we stack a multi-layer deep polynomial network (DPN) and integrate the features from multiple output layers via the weighting mechanism. In this way, the FDPN method not only can identify the high-level informative features of BFCN but also can solve the problem of curse of dimensionality.

Subsequently, the predictive efficacy and biologic basis of the proposed signature were investigated in an external cohort. A multicenter diagnostic trial (registration number: ChiCTR2000041310) was also performed to evaluate its clinical utility. Finally, on the basis of the N2 risk scores, the instructive significance of the signature in prognostic stratification was explored. The diagnostic efficiency was quantified with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the survival outcomes were assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results A total of 3096 patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 60 years ± 9; 1703 men) were included in the study. The proposed signature achieved AUCs of 0.82, 0.81, and 0.81 in an internal test set (n = 266), external test cohort (n = 133), and prospective test cohort (n = 300), respectively. In addition, higher deep learning scores were associated with a lower frequency of EGFR mutation (P = .04), higher rate of ALK fusion (P = .02), and more activation of pathways of tumor proliferation (P &lt; .001).

Antigenic drift and antigenic jump/shift, which arise from the accumulation of mutations with small or moderate effects and from a major, abrupt change with large effects on the surface antigen hemagglutinin (HA), respectively, are two types of antigenic variation that facilitate immune evasion of flu virus A and make it challenging to predict the antigenic properties of new viral strains. Despite considerable progress in modeling antigenic variation based on the amino acid sequences, few studies focus on the deep learning framework which could be most suitable to be applied to this task. Here, we propose a novel deep learning approach that incorporates a convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long-short-term memory (BLSTM) neural network to predict antigenic variation. In this approach, CNN extracts the complex local contexts of amino acids while the BLSTM neural network captures the long-distance sequence information. When compared to the existing methods, our deep learning approach achieves the overall highest prediction performance on the validation dataset, and more encouragingly, it achieves prediction agreements of 99.20% and 96.46% for the strains in the forthcoming year and in the next two years included in an existing set of chronological amino acid sequences, respectively. These results indicate that our deep learning approach is promising to be applied to antigenic variation prediction of flu virus A H3N2.",0.13136782886762677,computer vision,CNN

As an animal-origin pathogen, coronavirus can cross species barrier and cause pandemic in humans. In this study, a deep learning model for early prediction of pandemic risk was proposed based on the sequences of viral genomes.
METHODS: A total of 3257 genomes were downloaded from the Coronavirus Genome Resource Library. We present a deep learning model of cross-species coronavirus infection that combines a bidirectional gated recurrent unit network with a one-dimensional convolution. The genome sequence of animal-origin coronavirus was directly input to extract features and predict pandemic risk. The best performances were explored with the use of pre-trained DNA vector and attention mechanism. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under precision-recall curve (AUPR) were used to evaluate the predictive models.
RESULTS: The six specific models achieved good performances for the corresponding virus groups (1 for AUROC and 1 for AUPR). The general model with pre-training vector and attention mechanism provided excellent predictions for all virus groups (1 for AUROC and 1 for AUPR) while those without pre-training vector or attention mechanism had obviously reduction of performance (about 5-25%). Re-training experiments showed that the general model has good capabilities of transfer learning (average for six groups: 0.968 for AUROC and 0.942 for AUPR) and should give reasonable prediction for potential pathogen of next pandemic. The artificial negative data with the replacement of the coding region of the spike protein were also predicted correctly (100% accuracy). With the application of the Python programming language, an easy-to-use tool was created to implements our predictor.
CONCLUSIONS: Robust deep learning model with pre-training vector and attention mechanism mastered the features from the whole genomes of animal-origin coronaviruses and could predict the risk of cross-species infection for early warning of next pandemic.",0.12008745929556155,other,Unknown

As the name suggests, this model is derived by isolating the topmost layer from the remainder of the neural network, followed by imposing certain constraints separately on the two parts of the network. We demonstrate that the Layer-Peeled Model, albeit simple, inherits many characteristics of well-trained neural networks, thereby offering an effective tool for explaining and predicting common empirical patterns of deep-learning training. First, when working on class-balanced datasets, we prove that any solution to this model forms a simplex equiangular tight frame, which, in part, explains the recently discovered phenomenon of neural collapse [V. Papyan, X. Y. Han, D. L. Donoho, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 117, 24652-24663 (2020)]. More importantly, when moving to the imbalanced case, our analysis of the Layer-Peeled Model reveals a hitherto-unknown phenomenon that we term Minority Collapse, which fundamentally limits the performance of deep-learning models on the minority classes. In addition, we use the Layer-Peeled Model to gain insights into how to mitigate Minority Collapse. Interestingly, this phenomenon is first predicted by the Layer-Peeled Model before being confirmed by our computational experiments.",0.11310664167785217,other,Unknown

The incidences of community acquired; nosocomial fungal infections have increased dramatically after the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in number of patients with immunodeficiency / immunosuppression related diseases, resistance to existing antifungal compounds and availability of limited therapeutic options has triggered the search for alternative antifungal molecules. In this direction, antifungal peptides (AFPs) have received a lot of interest as an alternative to currently available antifungal drugs. Although the AFPs are produced by diverse population of living organisms, identifying effective AFPs from natural sources is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, there is a need to develop a robust in silico model capable of identifying novel AFPs in protein sequences. In this paper, we propose Deep-AFPpred, a deep learning classifier that can identify AFPs in protein sequences. We developed Deep-AFPpred using the concept of transfer learning with 1DCNN-BiLSTM deep learning algorithm. The findings reveal that Deep-AFPpred beats other state-of-the-art AFP classifiers by a wide margin and achieved approximately 96% and 94% precision on validation and test data, respectively. Based on the proposed approach, an online prediction server is created and made publicly available at https://afppred.anvil.app/. Using this server, one can identify novel AFPs in protein sequences and the results are provided as a report that includes predicted peptides, their physicochemical properties and motifs. By utilizing this model, we identified AFPs in different proteins, which can be chemically synthesized in lab and experimentally validated for their antifungal activity.",0.12159608844773423,computer vision,Unknown

To explore the implications of integrating social distancing with evacuation operations, we describe this evacuation process as a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and solve it using a DNN (Deep Neural Network)-based solution (Deep Reinforcement Learning) and a non-DNN solution (Sweep Algorithm). A central question is whether Deep Reinforcement Learning provides sufficient extra routing efficiency to accommodate increased social distancing in a time-constrained evacuation operation. We found that, in comparison to the Sweep Algorithm, Deep Reinforcement Learning can provide decision-makers with more efficient routing. However, the evacuation time saved by Deep Reinforcement Learning does not come close to compensating for the extra time required for social distancing, and its advantage disappears as the emergency vehicle capacity approaches the number of people per household.",0.1728101588949545,other,Unknown

A systematic literature search was conducted to identify published original articles on end-to-end DL analysis of resting ECG signals for the detection of structural cardiac pathologies. Studies were excluded if the ECG was acquired by ambulatory, stress, intracardiac, or implantable devices, and if the pathology of interest was arrhythmic in nature. After duplicate reviewers screened search results, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included. Three articles used DL to detect LV systolic dysfunction, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89-0.93 and an accuracy of 98%.

Innovative approaches are needed to strengthen retention in OAT. We develop and compare traditional and deep learning-extensions of Cox regression to examine the potential for predicting time in OAT at individuals' first episode entry.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study in New South Wales, Australia including 16,576 people entering OAT for the first time between January 2006 and December 2017. We develop 12-month OAT cessation prediction models using traditional and deep learning-extensions of the Cox regression algorithm with predictors evaluated from linked administrative datasets. Proportion of explained variation, calibration, and discrimination are compared using 5 × 2 cross-validation.
RESULTS: Twelve-month cessation rate was 58.4%. The largest hazard ratios for earlier cessation from the deep learning model were observed for treatment factors, including private dosing points (HR=1.54, 95% CI=1.49-1.60) and buprenorphine medication (HR=1.43, 95% CI=1.39-1.46). Diagnostic codes for homelessness (HR=1.09, 95% CI=1.04-1.13), outpatient treatment for drug use disorders (HR=1.10, 95% CI=1.06-1.15), and occupant of vehicle accident (HR=1.04, 95% CI=1.01-1.07) from past-year health service presentations were identified as significant predictors of retention. We observed no improvement in performance of the deep learning model over traditional Cox regression.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning may be more useful in identifying novel risk factors of OAT retention from administrative data than evaluating individual-level risk. An increased focus on addressing structural issues at the population level and considering alternate models of care may be more effective at improving retention than delivering fully personalised OAT.",0.14750616983480078,other,Unknown

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a predictive model for enteral feeding intolerance in the intensive care unit patients with sepsis.
METHODS: In this dual-center, retrospective, case-control study, a total of 195 intensive care unit patients with sepsis were enrolled from June 2018 to June 2020. Data of 124 patients for 27 clinical indicators from one hospital were used to train the model, and data from 71 patients from another hospital were used to assess the external predictive performance. The predictive models included logistic regression, naive Bayesian, random forest, gradient boosting tree, and deep learning (multilayer artificial neural network) models.
RESULTS: Eighty-six (44.1%) patients were diagnosed with enteral feeding intolerance. The deep learning model achieved the best performance, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 (95% confidence interval = 0.74-0.90) and 0.79 (95% confidence interval = 0.68-0.89) in the training and external sets, respectively. The deep learning model showed good calibration; based on the decision curve analysis, the model's clinical benefit was considered useful. Lower respiratory tract infection was the most important contributing factor, followed by peptide EN and shock.

OBJECTIVES: Predicting CD using electronic health record (EHR) data would allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment of the condition, thus improving overall cardiovascular outcomes. The Guideline Advantage (TGA) is an American Heart Association ambulatory quality clinical data registry of EHR data representing 70 clinics distributed throughout the US, and has been used to monitor outpatient prevention and disease management outcome measures across populations and for longitudinal research on the impact of preventative care.
METHODS: For this study, we represented all time-series cardiovascular health (CVH) measures and the corresponding data collection time points for each patient by numerical embedding vectors. We then employed a deep learning technique-long-short term memory (LSTM) model-to predict CD from the vector of time-series CVH measures by 5-fold cross validation and compared the performance of this model to the results of deep neural networks, logistic regression, random forest, and Naïve Bayes models.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that the LSTM model outperformed other traditional machine learning models and achieved the best prediction performance as measured by the average area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC): 0.76 for LSTM, 0.71 for deep neural networks, 0.66 for logistic regression, 0.67 for random forest, and 0.59 for Naïve Bayes.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to perform an analysis of the expressed emotions in English tweets by Greek Twitter users during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece.
METHODS: The period of this study was from January 25, 2020 to June 30, 2020. Data collection was performed by using appropriate search words with the filter-streaming application programming interface of Twitter. The emotional analysis of the tweets that satisfied the inclusion criteria was achieved using a deep learning approach that performs better by utilizing recurrent neural networks on sequences of characters. Emotional epidemiology tools such as the 6 basic emotions, that is, joy, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and anger based on the Paul Ekman classification were adopted.
RESULTS: The most frequent emotion that was detected in the tweets was ""surprise"" at the emerging contagion, while the imposed isolation resulted mostly in ""anger"" (odds ratio 2.108, 95% CI 0.986-4.506). Although the Greeks felt rather safe during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, their positive and negative emotions reflected a masked ""flight or fight"" or ""fear versus anger"" response to the contagion.

Early mortality prediction among patients with cirrhosis might give healthcare providers more opportunity to effectively treat the condition. We hypothesized that laboratory test results and other related diagnoses would be associated with mortality in this population. Our another assumption was that a deep learning model could outperform the current Model for End Stage Liver disease (MELD) score in predicting mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized electronic health record data from 34,575 patients with a diagnosis of cirrhosis from a large medical center to study associations with mortality. Three time-windows of mortality (365 days, 180 days and 90 days) and two cases with different number of variables (all 41 available variables and 4 variables in MELD-NA) were studied. Missing values were imputed using multiple imputation for continuous variables and mode for categorical variables. Deep learning and machine learning algorithms, i.e., deep neural networks (DNN), random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR) were employed to study the associations between baseline features such as laboratory measurements and diagnoses for each time window by 5-fold cross validation method. Metrics such as area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to evaluate models.
RESULTS: Performance of models comprising all variables outperformed those with 4 MELD-NA variables for all prediction cases and the DNN model outperformed the LR and RF models. For example, the DNN model achieved an AUC of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 90, 180, and 365-day mortality respectively as compared to the MELD score, which resulted in corresponding AUCs of 0.81, 0.79, and 0.76 for the same instances. The DNN and LR models had a significantly better f1 score compared to MELD at all time points examined.
CONCLUSION: Other variables such as alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and hemoglobin were also top informative features besides the 4 MELD-Na variables. Machine learning and deep learning models outperformed the current standard of risk prediction among patients with cirrhosis.

We aimed to develop a deep learning-enabled ECG model for automatic screening for Brugada syndrome to identify these patients at an early point in time, thus allowing for life-saving therapy.
METHODS: A total of 276 ECGs with a type 1 Brugada ECG pattern (276 type 1 Brugada ECGs and another randomly retrieved 276 non-Brugada type ECGs for 1:1 allocation) were extracted from the hospital-based ECG database for a 2-stage analysis with a deep learning model. After trained network for identifying right bundle branch block pattern, we transferred the first-stage learning to the second task to diagnose the type 1 Brugada ECG pattern. The diagnostic performance of the deep learning model was compared with that of board-certified practicing cardiologists. The model was further validated in an independent ECG data set collected from hospitals in Taiwan and Japan.
RESULTS: The diagnoses by the deep learning model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.96, sensitivity 88.4%, specificity 89.1%) were highly consistent with the standard diagnoses (kappa coefficient 0.78). However, the diagnoses by the cardiologists were significantly different from the standard diagnoses, with only moderate consistency (kappa coefficient 0.63). In the independent ECG cohort, the deep learning model still reached a satisfactory diagnostic performance (AUC 0.89, sensitivity 86.0%, specificity 90.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first deep learning-enabled ECG model for diagnosing Brugada syndrome, which appears to be a robust screening tool with a diagnostic potential rivalling trained physicians.",0.1935127140178606,other,Unknown

Furthermore, the effect of hyperparameters optimization methods on improving the prediction accuracy of deep learning-based survival models was investigated. Of the 305 cases, 260 GBM patients were included in our analysis based on the following criteria: demographic information (i.e., age, Karnofsky performance score, gender, and race), tumor characteristic (i.e., laterality and location), details of post-surgical treatment (i.e., time to initiate concurrent chemoradiation therapy, standard treatment, and radiotherapy techniques), and last follow-up time as well as the molecular markers (i.e., O-6-methylguanine methyltransferase and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 status). Experimental results have demonstrated that age (Elderly > 65: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.213-2.18; p value = 0.001) and tumors located at multiple lobes ([HR] = 1.75; 95% [CI]: 1.177-2.61; p value = 0.006) were associated with poorer prognosis.

However, previous studies have not statistically reported the additional effect of patient variables on the image-only models. This study aimed to statistically evaluate the osteoporosis identification ability of deep learning by combining hip radiographs with patient variables. Materials andMethods: We collected a dataset containing 1699 images from patients who underwent skeletal-bone-mineral density measurements and hip radiography at a general hospital from 2014 to 2021. Osteoporosis was assessed from hip radiographs using convolutional neural network (CNN) models (ResNet18, 34, 50, 101, and 152). We also investigated ensemble models with patient clinical variables added to each CNN. Accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated as performance metrics. Furthermore, we statistically compared the accuracy of the image-only model with that of an ensemble model that included images plus patient factors, including effect size for each performance metric. Results: All metrics were improved in the ResNet34 ensemble model compared with the image-only model.

The retina possesses features that can be affected by gender differences, and the extent to which these features are captured via photography differs depending on the retinal image field.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare deep learning algorithms' performance in predicting gender based on different fields of fundus photographs (optic disc-centered, macula-centered, and peripheral fields).
METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included 172,170 fundus photographs of 9956 adults aged ≥40 years from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases Study. Optic disc-centered, macula-centered, and peripheral field fundus images were included in this study as input data for a deep learning model for gender prediction. Performance was estimated at the individual level and image level. Receiver operating characteristic curves for binary classification were calculated.
RESULTS: The deep learning algorithms predicted gender with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94 at the individual level and an AUC of 0.87 at the image level. Across the three image field types, the best performance was seen when using optic disc-centered field images (younger subgroups: AUC=0.91; older subgroups: AUC=0.86), and algorithms that used peripheral field images had the lowest performance (younger subgroups: AUC=0.85; older subgroups: AUC=0.76). Across the three ethnic subgroups, algorithm performance was lowest in the Indian subgroup (AUC=0.88) compared to that in the Malay (AUC=0.91) and Chinese (AUC=0.91) subgroups when the algorithms were tested on optic disc-centered images. Algorithms' performance in gender prediction at the image level was better in younger subgroups (aged <65 years; AUC=0.89) than in older subgroups (aged ≥65 years; AUC=0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that gender among the Asian population can be predicted with fundus photographs by using deep learning, and our algorithms' performance in terms of gender prediction differed according to the field of fundus photographs, age subgroups, and ethnic groups.

However, data sources, such as electronic health records, are observational and often plagued with various types of biases, e.g. confounding. Although randomized controlled trials are the gold standard to estimate the causal effects of treatment interventions on health outcomes, they are not always possible. Propensity score matching (PSM) is a popular statistical technique for observational data that aims at balancing the characteristics of the population assigned either to a treatment or to a control group, making treatment assignment and outcome independent upon these characteristics. However, matching subjects can reduce the sample size. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) maintains the sample size, but extreme values can lead to instability. While PSM and IPW have been historically used in conjunction with linear regression, machine learning methods -including deep learning with propensity dropout- have been proposed to account for nonlinear treatment assignments. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning approach -the Propensity Score Synthetic Augmentation Matching using Generative Adversarial Networks (PSSAM-GAN)- that aims at keeping the sample size, without IPW, by generating synthetic matches. PSSAM-GAN can be used in conjunction with any other prediction method to estimate treatment effects. Experiments performed on both semi-synthetic (perinatal interventions) and real-world observational data (antibiotic treatments, and job interventions) show that the PSSAM-GAN approach effectively creates balanced datasets, relaxing the weighting/dropout needs for downstream methods, and providing competitive performance in effects estimation as compared to simple GAN and in conjunction with other deep counterfactual learning architectures, e.g. TARNet.",0.12077559402270538,other,"linear regression, GAN"

Here, we present, describe and make freely available an annotated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image dataset. It constitutes an interesting challenge for many practical applications in virology and epidemiology; e.g., virus detection, segmentation, classification, and novelty detection. We also present benchmarking results for virus detection and recognition using some of the top-performing (large and small) networks as well as a handcrafted very small network. We compare and evaluate transfer learning and training from scratch hypothesizing that with a limited dataset, transfer learning is crucial for good performance of a large network whereas our handcrafted small network performs relatively well when training from scratch. This is one step towards understanding how much training data is needed for a given task.
METHODS: The benchmark dataset contains 1245 images of 22 virus classes. We propose a representative data split into training, validation, and test sets for this dataset. Moreover, we compare different established DL networks and present a baseline DL solution for classifying a subset of the 14 most-represented virus classes in the dataset.
RESULTS: Our best model, DenseNet201 pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on the training set, achieved a 0.921 F1-score and 93.1% accuracy on the proposed representative test set.
CONCLUSIONS: Public and real biomedical datasets are an important contribution and a necessity to increase the understanding of shortcomings, requirements, and potential improvements for deep learning solutions on biomedical problems or deploying solutions in clinical settings.

Since the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) can be potentially used for diagnosing dementia-related disorders, it can be leveraged to develop a computer-aided screening tool.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if a machine learning model that uses images from the CDT can predict mild cognitive impairment or dementia.
METHODS: Images of an analog clock drawn by 3,263 cognitively intact and 160 impaired subjects were collected during in-person dementia evaluations by the Framingham Heart Study. We processed the CDT images, participant's age, and education level using a deep learning algorithm to predict dementia status.
RESULTS: When only the CDT images were used, the deep learning model predicted dementia status with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 81.3% ± 4.3%. A composite logistic regression model using age, level of education, and the predictions from the CDT-only model, yielded an average AUC and average F1 score of 91.9% ±1.1% and 94.6% ±0.4%, respectively.

However, standard pure-statistical feature selection approaches often fail to incorporate prior biological knowledge and select genes that lack biological insights. Besides, due to the high dimensionality and low sample size properties of microarray data, selecting robust gene features is an intrinsically challenging problem. We hence combined systems biology feature selection with ensemble learning in this study, aiming to select genes with biological insights and robust prognostic predictive power. Moreover, to capture breast cancer's complex molecular processes, we adopted a multi-gene approach to predict the prognosis status using deep learning classifiers. We found that all ensemble approaches could improve feature selection robustness, wherein the hybrid ensemble approach led to the most robust result. Among all prognosis prediction models, the bimodal deep neural network (DNN) achieved the highest test performance, further verified by survival analysis. In summary, this study demonstrated the potential of combining ensemble learning and bimodal DNN in guiding precision medicine.",0.11831797473493488,other,Unknown

In this study, we developed a machine learning-driven predictive risk model for all-cause mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using multiparametric approach with data from different domains.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study used territory-wide data of patients with type 2 diabetes attending public hospitals or their associated ambulatory/outpatient facilities in Hong Kong between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality. The association of risk variables and all-cause mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Machine and deep learning approaches were used to improve overall survival prediction and were evaluated with fivefold cross validation method.
RESULTS: A total of 273 678 patients (mean age: 65.4±12.7 years, male: 48.2%, median follow-up: 142 (IQR=106-142) months) were included, with 91 155 deaths occurring on follow-up (33.3%; annualized mortality rate: 3.4%/year; 2.7 million patient-years). Multivariate Cox regression found the following significant predictors of all-cause mortality: age, male gender, baseline comorbidities, anemia, mean values of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglyceride, HbA1c and fasting blood glucose (FBG), measures of variability of both HbA1c and FBG. The above parameters were incorporated into a score-based predictive risk model that had a c-statistic of 0.73 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.77), which was improved to 0.86 (0.81 to 0.90) and 0.87 (0.84 to 0.91) using random survival forests and deep survival learning models, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A multiparametric model incorporating variables from different domains predicted all-cause mortality accurately in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Current deep learning methods allow for various effects and interactions and have shown improved performance, but they typically need to be trained on a large amount of data to obtain reliable results. Gene expression studies often have small sample sizes but high dimensional correlated predictors so that traditional deep learning methods are not readily applicable.
RESULTS: In this article, we proposed peel learning, a novel neural network that incorporates the prior relationship among genes. In each layer of learning, overall structure is peeled into multiple local substructures. Within the substructure, dependency among variables is reduced through linear projections. The overall structure is gradually simplified over layers and weight parameters are optimized through a revised backpropagation. We applied PL to a small lung transplantation study to predict recipients' post-surgery primary graft dysfunction using donors' gene expressions within several immunology pathways, where PL showed improved prediction accuracy compared to conventional penalized regression, classification trees, feed-forward neural network and a neural network assuming prior network structure. Through simulation studies, we also demonstrated the advantage of adding specific structure among predictor variables in neural network, over no or uniform group structure, which is more favorable in smaller studies. The empirical evidence is consistent with our theoretical proof of improved upper bound of PL's complexity over ordinary neural networks.

To determine the best treatment, detecting EGFR and KRAS mutations is of interest. However, non-invasive ways to obtain this information are not available. Furthermore, many times there is a lack of big enough relevant public datasets, so the performance of single classifiers is not outstanding. In this paper, an ensemble approach is applied to increase the performance of EGFR and KRAS mutation prediction using a small dataset. A new voting scheme, Selective Class Average Voting (SCAV), is proposed and its performance is assessed both for machine learning models and CNNs. For the EGFR mutation, in the machine learning approach, there was an increase in the sensitivity from 0.66 to 0.75, and an increase in AUC from 0.68 to 0.70. With the deep learning approach, an AUC of 0.846 was obtained, and with SCAV, the accuracy of the model was increased from 0.80 to 0.857.

We developed computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for hip fractures on plain X-rays using a deep learning model trained on a large dataset. In this study, we examined whether the accuracy of the diagnosis of hip fracture of the residents could be improved by using this system.
METHODS: A deep convolutional neural network approach was used for machine learning. Pytorch 1.3 and Fast.ai 1.0 were applied as frameworks, and an EfficientNet-B4 model (a pre-trained ImageNet model) was used. We handled the 5295 X-rays from the patients with femoral neck fracture or femoral trochanteric fracture from 2009 to 2019. We excluded cases in which the bilateral hips were not included within an image range, and cases of femoral shaft fracture and periprosthetic fracture. Finally, we included 5242 AP pelvic X-rays from 4851 cases. We divided these 5242 images into two images per image, and prepared 5242 images including fracture site and 5242 images without fracture site. Thus, a total of 10,484 images were used for machine learning. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-value, and area under the curve (AUC) were assessed. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to conceptualize the basis for the diagnosis of the fracture by the deep learning algorithm. Secondly, we conducted a controlled experiment with clinicians. Thirty-one residents;young doctors within 2 years of graduation from medical school who rotate through various specialties, were tested using 300 hip fracture images that were randomly extracted from the dataset. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy with and without the use of the CAD system for each of the 300 images.
RESULTS: The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-value, and AUC were 96.1, 95.2, 96.9%, 0.961, and 0.99, respectively, with the correct diagnostic basis generated by Grad-CAM. In the controlled experiment, the diagnostic accuracy of the residents significantly improved when they used the CAD system.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a newly CAD system with a deep learning algorithm from a relatively large dataset from multiple institutions. Our system achieved high diagnostic performance. Our system improved the diagnostic accuracy of residents for hip fractures.

The clinical course of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is variable, and no reliable methods are available to predict mortality. Based on the hypothesis that machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques could enhance the identification of patients at risk, we applied a deep neural network to information available in electronic health records (EHR) to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with SCAD. We extracted patient data from the EHR of an extensive urban health system and applied several ML and DL models using candidate clinical variables potentially associated with mortality. We partitioned the data into training and evaluation sets with cross-validation. We estimated model performance based on the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC) and balanced accuracy. As sensitivity analyses, we examined results limited to cases with complete clinical information available.

Early prediction of AKI is essential in order to trigger the use of preventive care actions.
METHODS: The aim of this study was to ascertain the accuracy of two mathematical analysis models in obtaining a predictive score for AKI development. A deep learning model based on a urine output trends was compared with a logistic regression analysis for AKI prediction in stages 2 and 3 (defined as the simultaneous increase of serum creatinine and decrease of urine output, according to  the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) guidelines). Two retrospective datasets including 35,573 ICU patients were analyzed. Urine output data were used to train and test the logistic regression and the deep learning model.
RESULTS: The deep learning model defined an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 (± 0.01), sensitivity = 0.8 and specificity = 0.84, which was higher than the logistic regression analysis. The deep learning model was able to predict 88% of AKI cases more than 12 h before their onset: for every 6 patients identified as being at risk of AKI by the deep learning model, 5 experienced the event. On the contrary, for every 12 patients not considered to be at risk by the model, 2 developed AKI.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, by using urine output trends, deep learning analysis was able to predict AKI episodes more than 12 h in advance, and with a higher accuracy than the classical urine output thresholds. We suggest that this algorithm could be integrated in the ICU setting to better manage, and potentially prevent, AKI episodes.",0.20542417406728336,other,logistic regression

This makes it more difficult to provide adequate primary care services, which include connecting patients to an appropriate medical specialist. A smartphone-compatible artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that classifies patients' symptoms and recommends the appropriate medical specialty could provide a valuable solution.
OBJECTIVE: In order to establish a contactless method of recommending the appropriate medical specialty, this study aimed to construct a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and to develop an AI chatbot that can be used on a smartphone.
METHODS: We collected 118,008 sentences containing information on symptoms with labels (medical specialty), conducted data cleansing, and finally constructed a pipeline of 51,134 sentences for this study. Several deep learning models, including 4 different long short-term memory (LSTM) models with or without attention and with or without a pretrained FastText embedding layer, as well as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for NLP, were trained and validated using a randomly selected test data set. The performance of the models was evaluated on the basis of the precision, recall, F<sub>1</sub>-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AI chatbot was also designed to make it easy for patients to use this specialty recommendation system. We used an open-source framework called ""Alpha"" to develop our AI chatbot. This takes the form of a web-based app with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in text and a backend cloud-based server application to handle data collection, process the data with a deep learning model, and offer the medical specialty recommendation in a responsive web that is compatible with both desktops and smartphones.
RESULTS: The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.964 and F<sub>1</sub>-score of 0.768, followed by LSTM model with embedding vectors, with an AUC of 0.965 and F<sub>1</sub>-score of 0.739. Considering the limitations of computing resources and the wide availability of smartphones, the LSTM model with embedding vectors trained on our data set was adopted for our AI chatbot service. We also deployed an Alpha version of the AI chatbot to be executed on both desktops and smartphones.
CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing need for telemedicine during the current COVID-19 pandemic, an AI chatbot with a deep learning-based NLP model that can recommend a medical specialty to patients through their smartphones would be exceedingly useful. This chatbot allows patients to identify the proper medical specialist in a rapid and contactless manner, based on their symptoms, thus potentially supporting both patients and primary care providers.",0.10047055135878247,text mining,LSTM

Differentiating these lymph nodes is difficult in the absence of a known primary tumor or reliable medical history. In this study, we assessed the utility of deep learning in differentiating the pathologic lymph nodes of PTC, TB, and HPV+OPSCC on CT.
METHODS: A total of 173 lymph nodes (55 PTC, 58 TB, and 60 HPV+OPSCC) were selected based on pathology records and suspicious morphological features. These lymph nodes were divided into the training set (n = 131) and the test set (n = 42). In deep learning analysis, JPEG lymph node images were extracted from the CT slice that included the largest area of each node and fed into a deep learning training session to create a diagnostic model. Transfer learning was used with the deep learning model architecture of ResNet-101. Using the test set, the diagnostic performance of the deep learning model was compared against the histopathological diagnosis and to the diagnostic performances of two board-certified neuroradiologists.
RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy of the deep learning model was 0.76 (=32/42), whereas those of Radiologist 1 and Radiologist 2 were 0.48 (=20/42) and 0.41 (=17/42), respectively. Deep learning derived diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher than both of the two neuroradiologists (P < 0.01, respectively).

Few clinical tools are available to identify patients at risk of these complications, which would flag them for screening tests and potentially life-saving interventions. In this retrospective analysis, we aimed to assess the ability of deep learning algorithms of longitudinal data from two prospective cohorts to predict complications resulting in death after liver transplantation over multiple timeframes, compared with logistic regression models.
METHODS: In this machine learning analysis, model development was done on a set of 42 146 liver transplant recipients (mean age 48·6 years [SD 17·3]; 17 196 [40·8%] women) from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) in the USA. Transferability of the model was further evaluated by fine-tuning on a dataset from the University Health Network (UHN) in Canada (n=3269; mean age 52·5 years [11·1]; 1079 [33·0%] women). The primary outcome was cause of death, as recorded in the databases, due to cardiovascular causes, infection, graft failure, or cancer, within 1 year and 5 years of each follow-up examination after transplantation. We compared the performance of four deep learning models against logistic regression, assessing performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
FINDINGS: In both datasets, deep learning models outperformed logistic regression, with the Transformer model achieving the highest AUROCs in both datasets (p<0·0001). The AUROC for the Transformer model across all outcomes in the SRTR dataset was 0·804 (99% CI 0·795-0·854) for 1-year predictions and 0·733 (0·729-0·769) for 5-year predictions. In the UHN dataset, the AUROC for the top-performing deep learning model was 0·807 (0·795-0·842) for 1-year predictions and 0·722 (0·705-0·764) for 5-year predictions. AUROCs ranged from 0·695 (0·680-0·713) for prediction of death from infection within 5 years to 0·859 (0·847-0·871) for prediction of death by graft failure within 1 year.
INTERPRETATION: Deep learning algorithms can incorporate longitudinal information to continuously predict long-term outcomes after liver transplantation, outperforming logistic regression models. Physicians could use these algorithms at routine follow-up visits to identify liver transplant recipients at risk for adverse outcomes and prevent these complications by modifying management based on ranked features.

Since a typical clinical ultrasound image captures 2D information of a specific view plan of the kidney and images of the same kidney on different planes have varied appearances, it is challenging to develop a computer aided diagnosis tool robust to ultrasound images in different views. To overcome this problem, we develop a multi-instance deep learning method for distinguishing children with CAKUT from controls based on their clinical ultrasound images, aiming to automatic diagnose the CAKUT in children based on ultrasound imaging data. Particularly, a multi-instance deep learning method was developed to build a robust pattern classifier to distinguish children with CAKUT from controls based on their ultrasound images in sagittal and transverse views obtained during routine clinical care. The classifier was built on imaging features derived using transfer learning from a pre-trained deep learning model with a mean pooling operator for fusing instance-level classification results. Experimental results have demonstrated that the multi-instance deep learning classifier performed better than classifiers built on either individual sagittal slices or individual transverse slices.",0.17613214444890035,computer vision,Unknown

METHODS: Conventional radiographs of the sacroiliac joints obtained in two independent studies of patients with axSpA were used. The first cohort comprised 1553 radiographs and was split into training (n = 1324) and validation (n = 229) sets. The second cohort comprised 458 radiographs and was used as an independent test dataset. All radiographs were assessed in a central reading session, and the final decision on the presence or absence of definite radiographic sacroiliitis was used as a reference. The performance of the neural network was evaluated by calculating areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) as well as sensitivity and specificity.

To assess the potential to further improve performance of HRME image analysis, we also conducted a retrospective analysis assessing performance of a multi-task convolutional neural network to segment and classify HRME images. One thousand four hundred eighty-six subjects completed the study; 435 (29%) subjects had CIN Grade 2 or more severe (CIN2+) diagnosis.

The objective was to develop and evaluate the performance of a novel multimodal, multitask, multiattention (M3) deep learning framework on RPD detection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A deep learning framework (M3) was developed to detect RPD presence accurately using CFP alone, FAF alone, or both, employing >8000 CFP-FAF image pairs obtained prospectively (Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2). The M3 framework includes multimodal (detection from single or multiple image modalities), multitask (training different tasks simultaneously to improve generalizability), and multiattention (improving ensembled feature representation) operation. Performance on RPD detection was compared with state-of-the-art deep learning models and 13 ophthalmologists; performance on detection of 2 other AMD features (geographic atrophy and pigmentary abnormalities) was also evaluated.
RESULTS: For RPD detection, M3 achieved an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.832, 0.931, and 0.933 for CFP alone, FAF alone, and both, respectively. M3 performance on CFP was very substantially superior to human retinal specialists (median F1 score = 0.644 vs 0.350).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used 2 randomized prospective datasets, a semisynthetic one with nonlinear/nonparallel treatment selection bias and simulated counterfactual outcomes from the Infant Health and Development Program and a real-world dataset from the LaLonde's employment training program. We compared different configurations of the DPN-SA against logistic regression and LASSO as well as deep counterfactual networks with propensity dropout (DCN-PD). Models' performances were assessed in terms of average treatment effects, mean squared error in precision on effect's heterogeneity, and average treatment effect on the treated, over multiple training/test runs.
RESULTS: The DPN-SA outperformed logistic regression and LASSO by 36%-63%, and DCN-PD by 6%-10% across all datasets. All deep learning architectures yielded average treatment effects close to the true ones with low variance. Results were also robust to noise-injection and addition of correlated variables. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/Shantanu48114860/DPN-SAz.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Deep sparse autoencoders are particularly suited for treatment effect estimation studies using electronic health records because they can handle high-dimensional covariate sets, large sample sizes, and complex heterogeneity in treatment assignments.",0.13123028828722058,other,"logistic regression, autoencoder"

J48 decision tree method classifies the deep characteristics of affected X-ray corona images to detect the contaminated patients effectively. Eleven different convolutional neuronal network-based (CNN) models were developed in this study to detect infected patients with coronavirus pneumonia using X-ray images (AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet500, ResNet101, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201 and XceptionNet). In addition, the parameters of the CNN profound learning model are described using an emperor penguin optimizer with several objectives (MOEPO). A broad review reveals that the proposed model can categorise the X-ray images at the correct rates of precision, accuracy, recall, specificity and F1-score. Extensive test results show that the proposed model outperforms competitive models with well-known efficiency metrics.

Machine learning models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one machine learning algorithm and limited performance evaluation to area under the curve analysis. To obtain the best results possible, it may be important to test different machine learning algorithms to find the best prediction model.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to use automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted patients' chances of surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we identified which variables (ie, vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc) were the most influential in generating an accurate model.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution between March 1 and July 3, 2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time (ie, real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity). Patients were followed for 30 days or until death. Patients' data were used to build 20 machine learning models with various algorithms via autoML. The performance of machine learning models was measured by analyzing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPCR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability via Shapley additive explanation and partial dependence plots to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions. Afterward, we conducted dimensionality reduction to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML models were retrained by only using these 10 variables, and the output models were evaluated against the model that used 48 variables.
RESULTS: Data from 4313 patients were used to develop the models. The best model that was generated by using autoML and 48 variables was the stacked ensemble model (AUPRC=0.807). The two best independent models were the gradient boost machine and extreme gradient boost models, which had an AUPRC of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. The deep learning model (AUPRC=0.73) was substantially inferior to the other models. The 10 most influential variables for generating high-performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry level, blood urea nitrogen level, lactate dehydrogenase level, D-dimer level, troponin level, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. After the autoML models were retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model still had the best performance (AUPRC=0.791).
CONCLUSIONS: We used autoML to develop high-performing models that predicted the survival of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method for generating machine learning-based clinical decision support tools.",0.11448121805771119,other,Unknown

METHODS: IVCM images were collected from both male and female age-matched rhesus and pigtailed macaques housed at the Johns Hopkins University breeding colony using the Heidelberg HRTIII with Rostock Corneal Module. We also obtained repeat IVCM images of 12 SIV-infected animals including preinfection and 10-day post-SIV infection time points. All IVCM images were analyzed using a deep convolutional neural network architecture developed specifically for macaque studies.
RESULTS: Deep learning-based segmentation of subbasal nerves in IVCM images from macaques demonstrated that corneal nerve fiber length and fractal dimension measurements did not differ between species, but pigtailed macaques had significantly higher baseline corneal nerve fiber tortuosity than rhesus macaques (P = 0.005). Neither sex nor age of macaques was associated with differences in any of the assessed corneal subbasal nerve parameters. In the SIV/macaque model of human immunodeficiency virus, acute SIV infection induced significant decreases in both corneal nerve fiber length and fractal dimension (P = 0.01 and P = 0.008, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of IVCM and robust objective deep learning analysis is a powerful tool to track sensory nerve damage, enabling early detection of neuropathy. Adapting deep learning analyses to clinical corneal nerve assessments will improve monitoring of small sensory nerve fiber damage in numerous clinical settings including human immunodeficiency virus.",0.10406362933231951,computer vision,Unknown

The virus, which first appeared as a sign of pneumonia, was later called the SARS-COV-2 with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome by the World Health Organization. The SARS-COV-2 virus is triggered by binding to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE 2) inhibitor, which is vital in cardiovascular diseases and the immune system, especially in conditions such as cerebrovascular, hypertension, and diabetes. This study aims to evaluate the prediction performance of death status based on the demographic/clinical factors (including COVID-19 severity) by data mining methods.
METHODS: The dataset consists of 1603 SARS-COV-2 patients and 13 variables obtained from an open-source web address. The current dataset contains age, gender, chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, renal, cardiovascular, etc.), some enzymes (ACE, angiotensin II receptor blockers), and COVID-19 severity, which are used to predict death status using deep learning and machine learning approaches (random forest, k-nearest neighbor, extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]). A grid search algorithm tunes hyperparameters of the models, and predictions are assessed through performance metrics. Steps of knowledge discovery in databases are applied to obtain the relevant information.
RESULTS: The accuracy rate of deep learning (97.15%) was more successful than the accuracy rate based on classical machine learning (92.15% for RF and 93.4% for k-NN), but the ensemble classifier XGBoost method gave the highest accuracy (99.7%). While COVID-19 severity and age calculated from XGBoost were the two most important factors associated with death status, the most determining variables for death status estimated from deep learning were COVID-19 severity and hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model (XGBoost) achieved the best prediction of death status based on the factors as compared to the other algorithms. The results of this study can guide patients with certain variables to take early measures and access preventive health care services before they become infected with the virus.",0.15438134343291315,other,random forest

However, automating a social media-based monitoring system is challenging-requiring advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning methods. In this paper, we describe the development and evaluation of automatic text classification models for detecting self-reports of PM abuse from Twitter.
METHODS: We experimented with state-of-the-art bi-directional transformer-based language models, which utilize tweet-level representations that enable transfer learning (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, AlBERT, and DistilBERT), proposed fusion-based approaches, and compared the developed models with several traditional machine learning, including deep learning, approaches. Using a public dataset, we evaluated the performances of the classifiers on their abilities to classify the non-majority ""abuse/misuse"" class.
RESULTS: Our proposed fusion-based model performs significantly better than the best traditional model (F<sub>1</sub>-score [95% CI]: 0.67 [0.64-0.69] vs. 0.45 [0.42-0.48]). We illustrate, via experimentation using varying training set sizes, that the transformer-based models are more stable and require less annotated data compared to the other models. The significant improvements achieved by our best-performing classification model over past approaches makes it suitable for automated continuous monitoring of nonmedical PM use from Twitter.
CONCLUSIONS: BERT, BERT-like and fusion-based models outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning models, achieving substantial improvements over many years of past research on the topic of prescription medication misuse/abuse classification from social media, which had been shown to be a complex task due to the unique ways in which information about nonmedical use is presented.

It allows both patients and caregivers to plan resources, time and intensity of care to provide the best possible treatment path for the patients. In this paper, by focusing on lung cancer patients, we build several survival prediction models using deep learning techniques to tackle both cancer survival classification and regression problems. We also conduct feature importance analysis to understand how lung cancer patients' relevant factors impact their survival periods. We contribute to identifying an approach to estimate survivability that are commonly and practically appropriate for medical use.
METHODOLOGIES: We have compared the performance across three of the most popular deep learning architectures - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) while comparing the performing of deep learning models against traditional machine learning models. The data was obtained from the lung cancer section of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry.
RESULTS: The deep learning models outperformed traditional machine learning models across both classification and regression approaches. We obtained a best of 71.18 % accuracy for the classification approach when patients' survival periods are segmented into classes of '&lt;=6 months',' 0.5 - 2 years' and '&gt;2 years' and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 13.5 % andR2 value of 0.5 for the regression approach for the deep learning models while the traditional machine learning models saturated at 61.12 % classification accuracy and 14.87 % RMSE in regression.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach can be a baseline for early prediction with predictions that can be further improved with more temporal treatment information collected from treated patients.

In this study, using CT images from Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients recruited in two independent hospitals, we discovered most transfer learning features have weak linear relationships with radiomics features, suggesting a potential complementary relationship between these two feature sets. We also tested the prognostic performance for overall survival using four feature fusion and reduction methods for combining radiomics and transfer learning features and compared the results with our proposed risk score-based feature fusion method. It was shown that the risk score-based feature fusion method significantly improves the prognosis performance for predicting overall survival in PDAC patients compared to other traditional feature reduction methods used in previous radiomics studies (40% increase in area under ROC curve (AUC) yielding AUC of 0.84).",0.15928891962068242,computer vision,Unknown

As brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important tool to distinguish the two diseases, extensive research has been conducted to identify the defining characteristics of MRI images corresponding to these two diseases. However, the application of such research in clinical practice is still limited. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a deep learning-based algorithm for differentiating NMOSD from MS. Methods: In this study, we included 338 participants (213 patients with MS, 125 patients with NMOSD) who visited the Asan medical center between February 2009 and February 2020. A 3D convolutional neural network, which is a deep learning-based algorithm, was trained using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and clinical information of the participants. The performance of the final model in differentiating NMOSD from MS was evaluated and compared with that of two neurologists. Results: The deep learning-based model exhibited an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.75-0.89). It differentiated NMOSD from MS with an accuracy of 71.1% (sensitivity = 87.8%, specificity = 61.6%), which is comparable to that exhibited by the neurologists. The intra-rater reliability of the two neurologists was moderate (κ = 0.47, 0.50), which was in contrast with the consistent classification of the deep learning-based model. Conclusion: The proposed model was verified to be capable of differentiating NMOSD from MS with accuracy comparable to that of neurologists, exhibiting the advantage of consistent classification. As a result, it can aid differential diagnosis between two important central nervous system inflammatory diseases in clinical practice.",0.12464466451461999,computer vision,Unknown

The computer-aided diagnosis with deep learning methods can perform automatic detection of COVID-19 using CT scans.

To meet the challenge, we propose a weakly-supervised deep active learning framework called COVID-AL to diagnose COVID-19 with CT scans and patient-level labels. The COVID-AL consists of the lung region segmentation with a 2D U-Net and the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a novel hybrid active learning strategy, which simultaneously considers sample diversity and predicted loss. With a tailor-designed 3D residual network, the proposed COVID-AL can diagnose COVID-19 efficiently and it is validated on a large CT scan dataset collected from the CC-CCII. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed COVID-AL outperforms the state-of-the-art active learning approaches in the diagnosis of COVID-19. With only 30% of the labeled data, the COVID-AL achieves over 95% accuracy of the deep learning method using the whole dataset.

Current approaches to prognostication rely upon conventional statistical methods such as Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models and have suboptimal predictive ability. Given the success of deep learning approaches in other specialties, we sought to develop and compare deep learning models with CPH models for the prediction of 5-year survival in pediatric GU-RMS patients.
METHODS: Patients less than 20 years of age with GU-RMS were identified within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (1998-2011). Deep neural networks (DNN) were trained and tested on an 80/20 split of the dataset in a 5-fold cross-validated fashion. Multivariable CPH models were developed in parallel. The primary outcomes were 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Variables used for prediction were age, sex, race, primary site, histology, degree of tumor extension, tumor size, receipt of surgery, and receipt of radiation. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted, and DNN models were tested for calibration.
RESULTS: 277 patients were included. The area under the curve (AUC) for the DNN models was 0.93 for OS and 0.91 for DSS. AUC for the CPH models was 0.82 for OS and 0.84 for DSS. The DNN models were well-calibrated: OS model (slope = 1.02, intercept = -0.06) and DSS model (slope = 0.79, intercept = 0.21).

Given its novelty and emergence in fields outside of biomedical research, machine learning terminology, techniques, and research findings may be unfamiliar to diabetes researchers. Our aim was to present the use of machine learning approaches in an approachable way, drawing from clinical epidemiological research in diabetes published from 1 Jan 2017 to 1 June 2020.
RECENT FINDINGS: Machine learning approaches using tree-based learners-which produce decision trees to help guide clinical interventions-frequently have higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional regression models for risk prediction. Machine learning approaches using neural networking and ""deep learning"" can be applied to medical image data, particularly for the identification and staging of diabetic retinopathy and skin ulcers. Among the machine learning approaches reviewed, researchers identified new strategies to develop standard datasets for rigorous comparisons across older and newer approaches, methods to illustrate how a machine learner was treating underlying data, and approaches to improve the transparency of the machine learning process. Machine learning approaches have the potential to improve risk stratification and outcome prediction for clinical epidemiology applications. Achieving this potential would be facilitated by use of universal open-source datasets for fair comparisons. More work remains in the application of strategies to communicate how the machine learners are generating their predictions.",0.1862487333626954,computer vision,Unknown

DESIGN: Analysis of existing database of posterior pole fundus images and corresponding ophthalmoscopic examinations using 2 methods of assigning a quantitative scale to vascular severity.
PARTICIPANTS: Images were from clinical examinations of patients in the Imaging and Informatics in ROP Consortium. Four ophthalmologists and 1 study coordinator evaluated vascular severity on a scale from 1 to 9.
METHODS: A quantitative vascular severity score (1-9) was applied to each image using a deep learning algorithm. A database of 499 images was developed for assessment of interobserver agreement.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Distribution of deep learning-derived vascular severity scores with the clinical assessment of zone (I, II, or III), stage (0, 1, 2, or 3), and extent (<3 clock hours, 3-6 clock hours, and >6 clock hours) of stage 3 evaluated using multivariate linear regression and weighted κ values and Pearson correlation coefficients for interobserver agreement on a 1-to-9 vascular severity scale.
RESULTS: For deep learning analysis, a total of 6344 clinical examinations were analyzed. A higher deep learning-derived vascular severity score was associated with more posterior disease, higher disease stage, and higher extent of stage 3 disease (P < 0.001 for all). For a given ROP stage, the vascular severity score was higher in zone I than zones II or III (P < 0.001). Multivariate regression found zone, stage, and extent all were associated independently with the severity score (P < 0.001 for all). For interobserver agreement, the mean ± standard deviation weighted κ value was 0.67 ± 0.06, and the Pearson correlation coefficient ± standard deviation was 0.88 ± 0.04 on the use of a 1-to-9 vascular severity scale.

However, the existing methods either focused on the detection of a single virus or required large amounts of manual labeling work to segment virus.

METHODS: We put forward a residual mixed attention network (RMAN) for virus classification. The proposed network uses channel attention, bottom-up and top-down attention, and incorporates a residual architecture in an end-to-end training manner, which is suitable for dealing with EM virus images and reducing the burden of manual annotation.
RESULTS: We validate the proposed network through extensive experiments on a transmission electron microscopy virus image dataset. The top-1 error rate of our RMAN on 12 virus classes is 4.285%, which surpasses that of state-of-the-art networks and even human experts. In addition, the ablation study and the visualization of class activation mapping (CAM) further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In this article, we proposed a hybrid weak label-based deep learning method that utilize both the manually annotated pulmonary opacities from COVID-19 pneumonia and the patient-level disease-type information available from the clinical report. A UNet was firstly trained with semantic labels to segment the total infected region. It was used to initialize another UNet, which was trained to segment the consolidations with patient-level information using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, multi-institutional CT datasets from Iran, Italy, South Korea, and the United States were utilized. Results show that our proposed method can predict the infected regions as well as the consolidation regions with good correlation to human annotation.",0.10274065174149385,computer vision,Unknown

We compare deep learning and machine learning models to a baseline logistic regression using only 'known' risk factors in predicting incident myocardial infarction (MI) from harmonized EHR data.
METHODS: Large-scale case-control study with outcome of 6-month incident MI, conducted using the top 800, from an initial 52 k procedures, diagnoses, and medications within the UCHealth system, harmonized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model, performed on 2.27 million patients. We compared several over- and under- sampling techniques to address the imbalance in the dataset. We compared regularized logistics regression, random forest, boosted gradient machines, and shallow and deep neural networks. A baseline model for comparison was a logistic regression using a limited set of 'known' risk factors for MI. Hyper-parameters were identified using 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: Twenty thousand Five hundred and ninety-one patients were diagnosed with MI compared with 2.25 million who did not. A deep neural network with random undersampling provided superior classification compared with other methods. However, the benefit of the deep neural network was only moderate, showing an F1 Score of 0.092 and AUC of 0.835, compared to a logistic regression model using only 'known' risk factors. Calibration for all models was poor despite adequate discrimination, due to overfitting from low frequency of the event of interest.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that DNN may not offer substantial benefit when trained on harmonized data, compared to traditional methods using established risk factors for MI.",0.14647316621275308,other,"random forest, logistic regression"

Neuroimaging techniques predominantly provide insight into anatomic structure changes associated with AD. Deep learning methods have been extensively applied towards creating and evaluating models capable of differentiating between cognitively unimpaired, patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD dementia. Several published approaches apply information fusion techniques, providing ways of combining several input sources in the medical domain, which contributes to knowledge of broader and enriched quality. The aim of this paper is to fuse sociodemographic data such as age, marital status, education and gender, and genetic data (presence of an apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 allele) with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. This enables enriched multi-modal features, that adequately represent the MRI scan visually and is adopted for creating and modeling classification systems capable of detecting amnestic MCI (aMCI). To fully utilize the potential of deep convolutional neural networks, two extra color layers denoting contrast intensified and blurred image adaptations are virtually augmented to each MRI scan, completing the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color channels. Deep convolutional activation features (DeCAF) are extracted from the average pooling layer of the deep learning system Inception_v3. These features from the fused MRI scans are used as visual representation for the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) classification model. The proposed approach is evaluated on a sub-study containing 120 participants (aMCI = 61 and cognitively unimpaired = 59) of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR) Study with a baseline model accuracy of 76%. Further evaluation was conducted on the ADNI Phase 1 dataset with 624 participants (aMCI = 397 and cognitively unimpaired = 227) with a baseline model accuracy of 66.27%. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves 90% accuracy and 0.90 F1-Score at classification of aMCI vs. cognitively unimpaired participants on the HNR Study dataset, and 77% accuracy and 0.83 F1-Score on the ADNI dataset.",0.10528672014679022,computer vision,"LSTM, RNN"

Seven cohorts with two years of data, three to eight years prior to index date, and an incident cohort were created. Four trained models for each cohort, boosted trees, feed forward network, recurrent neural network and recurrent neural network with pre-trained weights, were constructed and their performance compared using validation and test data. The incident model had an AUC of 94.4% and F1 score of 54.1%. Eight years removed from index date the AUC and F1 scores were 80.7% and 25.6%, respectively. The results for the remaining cohorts were between these ranges. Deep learning models can result in significant improvement in performance but come at a cost in terms of run times and hardware requirements. The results of the model at index date indicate that this modeling can be effective at stratifying patients at risk of dementia.

The experience of the 1918 influenza pandemic demonstrated that decreases in the infection rates of COVID-19 do not guarantee continuity of the trend.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a precise spread model of COVID-19 with time-dependent parameters via deep learning to respond promptly to the dynamic situation of the outbreak and proactively minimize damage.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated a mathematical model with time-dependent parameters via deep learning based on forward-inverse problems. We used data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University for Korea and the other countries, respectively. Because the data consist of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases, we selected the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and found approximated solutions as well as model parameters. Specifically, we applied fully connected neural networks to the solutions and parameters and designed suitable loss functions.
RESULTS: We developed an entirely new SIR model with time-dependent parameters via deep learning methods. Furthermore, we validated the model with the conventional Runge-Kutta fourth order model to confirm its convergent nature. In addition, we evaluated our model based on the real-world situation reported from the KCDC, the Korean government, and news media. We also crossvalidated our model using data from the CSSE for Italy, Sweden, and the United States.
CONCLUSIONS: The methodology and new model of this study could be employed for short-term prediction of COVID-19, which could help the government prepare for a new outbreak.

This poses a serious threat to the current and near-future health systems, given the association of these conditions with different comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, and metabolic syndrome) and even death. In order to design appropriate strategies for its prevention, as well as understand its origins, the development of predictive models for childhood/adolescent overweight/obesity and related outcomes is of extreme value. Obesity has a complex etiology, and in the case of childhood and adolescence obesity, this etiology includes also specific factors like (pre)-gestational ones; weaning; and the huge anthropometric, metabolic, and hormonal changes that during this period the body suffers. In this way, Machine Learning models are becoming extremely useful tools in this area, given their excellent predictive power; ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships between variables; and capacity to deal with high-dimensional data typical in this area. This is especially important given the recent appearance of large repositories of Electronic Health Records (EHR) that allow the development of models using datasets with many instances and predictor variables, from which Deep Learning variants can generate extremely accurate predictions.

We aimed to identify associations between clinical and radiographic features as well as to assess the feasibility of deep learning applied to chest X-rays in the setting of an acute COVID-19 outbreak.
METHODS: A retrospective study of X-rays, clinical, and laboratory data was performed from 48 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients (age 60±17 years, 15 women) between February 22 and March 6, 2020 from a tertiary care hospital in Milan, Italy. Sixty-five chest X-rays were reviewed by two radiologists for alveolar and interstitial opacities and classified by severity on a scale from 0 to 3. Clinical factors (age, symptoms, comorbidities) were investigated for association with opacity severity and also with placement of central line or endotracheal tube. Deep learning models were then trained for two tasks: lung segmentation and opacity detection. Imaging characteristics were compared to clinical datapoints using the unpaired student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Cohen's kappa analysis was used to evaluate the concordance of deep learning to conventional radiologist interpretation.
RESULTS: Fifty-six percent of patients presented with alveolar opacities, 73% had interstitial opacities, and 23% had normal X-rays. The presence of alveolar or interstitial opacities was statistically correlated with age (P = 0.008) and comorbidities (P = 0.005). The extent of alveolar or interstitial opacities on baseline X-ray was significantly associated with the presence of endotracheal tube (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.049) or central line (P = 0.003 and P = 0.007). In comparison to human interpretation, the deep learning model achieved a kappa concordance of 0.51 for alveolar opacities and 0.71 for interstitial opacities.
CONCLUSION: Chest X-ray analysis in an acute COVID-19 outbreak showed that the severity of opacities was associated with advanced age, comorbidities, as well as acuity of care.

Transmission parameters between compartments are typically estimated through stochastic parameterization processes that depends on detailed statistics of transmission characteristics, which are economically and resource-wise expensive to collect.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to apply deep learning techniques as a lower data dependency alternative to estimate transmission parameters of a customized compartmental model, for the purpose of simulating the dynamics of the US coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic and projecting its further development.
METHODS: We constructed a compartmental model and developed a multistep deep learning methodology to estimate the model's transmission parameters. We then fed the estimated transmission parameters to the model to predict development of the US COVID-19 epidemic for 35 and 42 days. Epidemics are considered suppressed when the basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>) is less than 1.
RESULTS: The deep learning-enhanced compartmental model predicts that R<sub>0</sub> will fall to &lt;1 around August 17-19, 2020, at which point the epidemic will effectively start to die out, and that the US ""infected"" population will peak around August 16-18, 2020, at 3,228,574 to 3,308,911 individual cases. The model also predicted that the number of accumulative confirmed cases will cross the 5 million mark around August 7, 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: Current compartmental models require stochastic parameterization to estimate the transmission parameters. These models' effectiveness depends upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics. As an alternative, deep learning techniques are effective in estimating these stochastic parameters with greatly reduced dependency on data particularity.",0.1448252748256855,other,Unknown

The purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning approach to achieve rapid detection of possible abnormalities in chest radiographs suggesting PH for screening patients suspected of PH.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected frontal chest radiographs and the pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) value measured by Doppler transthoracic echocardiography from 762 patients (357 healthy controls and 405 with PH) from three institutes in China from January 2013 to May 2019. The wohle sample comprised 762 images (641 for training, 80 for internal test, and 41 for external test). We firstly performed a 8-fold cross-validation on the 641 images selected for training (561 for pre-training, 80 for validation), then decided to tune learning rate to 0.0008 according to the best score on validation data. Finally, we used all the pre-training and validation data (561+80 = 641) to train our models (Resnet50, Xception, and Inception V3), evaluated them on internal and external test dataset to classify the images as having manifestations of PH or healthy according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC/ROC). After that, the three deep learning models were further used for prediction of PASP using regression algorithm. Moreover, we invited an experienced chest radiologist to classify the images in the test dataset as having PH or not, and compared the prediction accuracy performed by deep learing models with that of manual classification.
RESULTS: The AUC performed by the best model (Inception V3) achieved 0.970 in the internal test, and slightly declined in the external test (0.967) when using deep learning algorithms to classify PH from normal based on chest X-rays. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the best model for prediction of PASP value was smaller in the internal test (7.45) compared to 9.95 in the external test. Manual classification of PH based on chest X-rays showed much lower AUCs compared to that performed by deep learning models both in the internal and external test.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study used deep learning algorithms to classify abnormalities suggesting PH in chest radiographs with high accuracy and good generalizability. Once tested prospectively in clinical settings, the technology could provide a non-invasive and easy-to-use method to screen patients suspected of having PH.",0.16161309471317648,computer vision,Inception

Hand-crafted features, however, are pre-defined and extracted without taking the desired target into account. Furthermore, accurate segmentation of the tumor is required for development of a reliable predictive model, which may be objective and a time-consuming task. To address these drawbacks, we propose a deep learning-based radiomics model for the time-to-event outcome prediction, referred to as DRTOP that takes raw images as inputs, and calculates the image-based risk of death or recurrence, for each patient. Our experiments on an in-house dataset of 132 lung cancer patients show that the obtained image-based risks are significant predictors of the time-to-event outcomes. Computed Tomography (CT)-based features are predictors of the overall survival (OS), with the hazard ratio (HR) of 1.35, distant control (DC), with HR of 1.06, and local control (LC), with HR of 2.66. The Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-based features are predictors of OS and recurrence free survival (RFS), with hazard ratios of 1.67 and 1.18, respectively. The concordance indices of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] for predicting the OS, DC, and RFS show that the deep learning-based radiomics model is as accurate or better in predicting predefined clinical outcomes compared to hand-crafted radiomics, with concordance indices of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text], for predicting the OS, DC, and RFS, respectively.

It was trained on data from a large longitudinal study conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and has been shown to accurately identify cervices with early stages of cervical neoplasia for clinical evaluation and treatment. The algorithm processes images of the uterine cervix taken with a digital camera and alerts the user if the woman is a candidate for further evaluation. This requires that the algorithm be presented with images of the cervix, which is the object of interest, of acceptable quality, i.e., in sharp focus, with good illumination, without shadows or other occlusions, and showing the entire squamo-columnar transformation zone. Our prior work has addressed some of these constraints to help discard images that do not meet these criteria. In this work, we present a novel algorithm that determines that the image contains the cervix to a sufficient extent. Non-cervix or other inadequate images could lead to suboptimal or wrong results. Manual removal of such images is labor intensive and time-consuming, particularly in working with large retrospective collections acquired with inadequate quality control. In this work, we present a novel ensemble deep learning method to identify cervix images and non-cervix images in a smartphone-acquired cervical image dataset.

METHODS: A deep learning algorithm consisted of lesion detection, segmentation, and location was trained and validated in 14,435 participants with chest CT images and definite pathogen diagnosis. The algorithm was tested in a non-overlapping dataset of 96 confirmed COVID-19 patients in three hospitals across China during the outbreak. Quantitative detection performance of the model was compared with three radiological residents with two experienced radiologists' reading reports as reference standard by assessing the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score.
RESULTS: Of 96 patients, 88 had pneumonia lesions on CT images and 8 had no abnormities on CT images. For per-patient basis, the algorithm showed superior sensitivity of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95, 1.00) and F1 score of 0.97 in detecting lesions from CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia patients. While for per-lung lobe basis, the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.94, 0.98) and a slightly inferior F1 score of 0.86. The median volume of lesions calculated by algorithm was 40.10 cm3. An average running speed of 20.3 s ± 5.8 per case demonstrated the algorithm was much faster than the residents in assessing CT images (all p &lt; 0.017). The deep learning algorithm can also assist radiologists make quicker diagnosis (all p &lt; 0.0001) with superior diagnostic performance.
CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm showed excellent performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT images compared with resident radiologists.
KEY POINTS: • The higher sensitivity of deep learning model in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia were found compared with radiological residents on a per-lobe and per-patient basis. • The deep learning model improves diagnosis efficiency by shortening processing time. • The deep learning model can automatically calculate the volume of the lesions and whole lung.",0.21100217796254211,computer vision,Unknown

DESIGN: Retrospective literature review.
METHODS: To review the studies of both prospective and retrospective (post hoc) analyses of nutrition, genetic variants, and deep learning in AMD in both the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2.
RESULTS: In addition to demonstrating the beneficial effects of the AREDS and AREDS2 supplements of antioxidant vitamins and zinc (plus copper) for reducing the risk of progression to late AMD, these 2 studies also confirmed the importance of high adherence to Mediterranean diet in reducing progression of AMD in persons with varying severity of disease. In persons with the protective genetic alleles of complement factor H (CFH), the Mediterranean diet had further beneficial effect. However, despite the genetic association with AMD progression, prediction models found genetic information added little to the high predictive value of baseline severity of AMD for disease progression. The technique of deep learning, an arm of artificial intelligence, using color fundus photographs from AREDS/AREDS2 was superior in some cases and noninferior in others to clinical human grading (retinal specialists) and to the gold standard of the certified reading center graders.
CONCLUSIONS: Counseling individuals affected with AMD regarding the use of the AREDS2 supplements and the beneficial association of the Mediterranean diet is an important public health message. Although genetic testing is important in research, it is not recommended for prediction of disease or to guide therapies and/or dietary interventions in AMD. Techniques in deep learning hold great promise, but further prospective research is required to validate the use of this technique to provide improvement in accuracy and sensitivity/specificity in clinical research and medical management of patients with AMD.",0.11653361483610498,other,Unknown

Deep learning can detect MSI and dMMR in tumor samples on routine histology slides faster and less expensively than molecular assays. However, clinical application of this technology requires high performance and multisite validation, which have not yet been performed.
METHODS: We collected H&E-stained slides and findings from molecular analyses for MSI and dMMR from 8836 colorectal tumors (of all stages) included in the MSIDETECT consortium study, from Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Specimens with dMMR were identified by immunohistochemistry analyses of tissue microarrays for loss of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and/or PMS2. Specimens with MSI were identified by genetic analyses. We trained a deep-learning detector to identify samples with MSI from these slides; performance was assessed by cross-validation (N = 6406 specimens) and validated in an external cohort (n = 771 specimens). Prespecified endpoints were area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).
RESULTS: The deep-learning detector identified specimens with dMMR or MSI with a mean AUROC curve of 0.92 (lower bound, 0.91; upper bound, 0.93) and an AUPRC of 0.63 (range, 0.59-0.65), or 67% specificity and 95% sensitivity, in the cross-validation development cohort.

CONCLUSIONS: We developed a deep-learning system that detects colorectal cancer specimens with dMMR or MSI using H&E-stained slides; it detected tissues with dMMR with an AUROC of 0.96 in a large, international validation cohort.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the performances of DeepSurv, a deep learning survival neural network with a tumor, node, and metastasis staging system in the prediction of survival and test the reliability of individual treatment recommendations provided by the deep learning survival neural network.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this population-based cohort study, a deep learning-based algorithm was developed and validated using consecutive cases of newly diagnosed stages I to IV NSCLC between January 2010 and December 2015 in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. A total of 127 features, including patient characteristics, tumor stage, and treatment strategies, were assessed for analysis. The algorithm was externally validated on an independent test cohort, comprising 1182 patients with stage I to III NSCLC diagnosed between January 2009 and December 2013 in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. Analysis began January 2018 and ended June 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The deep learning survival neural network model was compared with the tumor, node, and metastasis staging system for lung cancer-specific survival. The C statistic was used to assess the performance of models. A user-friendly interface was provided to facilitate the survival predictions and treatment recommendations of the deep learning survival neural network model.
RESULTS: Of 17 322 patients with NSCLC included in the study, 13 361 (77.1%) were white and the median (interquartile range) age was 68 (61-74) years. The majority of tumors were stage I disease (10 273 [59.3%]) and adenocarcinoma (11 985 [69.2%]). The median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 24 (10-43) months. There were 3119 patients who had lung cancer-related death during the follow-up period. The deep learning survival neural network model showed more promising results in the prediction of lung cancer-specific survival than the tumor, node, and metastasis stage on the test data set (C statistic = 0.739 vs 0.706).

Performance was compared with 4 ophthalmologists using a random subset from the full test set.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), κ value, accuracy, and F1 score.
RESULTS: The FAF model had an AUC of 0.939 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.927-0.950), a κ value of 0.718 (95% CI, 0.685-0.751), and accuracy of 0.899 (95% CI, 0.887-0.911).

Here, we utilized publicly available HIV-1 sequence data and drug resistance assay results for 18 ART drugs to evaluate the performance of three architectures (multilayer perceptron, bidirectional recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural network) for drug resistance prediction, jointly with biological analysis. We identified convolutional neural networks as the best performing architecture and displayed a correspondence between the importance of biologically relevant features in the classifier and overall performance. Our results suggest that the high classification performance of deep learning models is indeed dependent on drug resistance mutations (DRMs). These models heavily weighted several features that are not known DRM locations, indicating the utility of model interpretability to address causal relationships in viral genotype-phenotype data.",0.11491650433172315,computer vision,Unknown

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), without interventions, the number of diabetic incidences is expected to be at least 629 million by 2045. Uncontrolled diabetes gradually leads to progressive damage to eyes, heart, kidneys, blood vessels, and nerves.
METHODS: The paper presents a critical review of existing statistical and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based machine learning techniques with respect to DM complications, mainly retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. The statistical and machine learning analytic techniques are used to structure the subsequent content review.
RESULTS: It has been observed that statistical analysis can help only in inferential and descriptive analysis whereas, AI-based machine learning models can even provide actionable prediction models for faster and accurate diagnosis of complications associated with DM.

It is, consequently, an expensive process that can, in addition, suffer from geospatial discrepancies, thus severely impairing the comparability of death statistics at the international level. The recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the rise of deep learning methods, has enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems that were typically considered out of reach without human assistance; they require a considerable amount of data to learn from, which is typically their main limiting factor. However, the CépiDc (Centre d'épidémiologie sur les causes médicales de Décès) stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale, amounting to several millions of training examples available for the machine learning practitioner.
OBJECTIVE: This article investigates the application of deep neural network methods to coding underlying causes of death.
METHODS: The investigated dataset was based on data contained from every French death certificate from 2000 to 2015, containing information such as the subject's age and gender, as well as the chain of events leading to his or her death, for a total of around 8 million observations. The task of automatically coding the subject's underlying cause of death was then formulated as a predictive modelling problem. A deep neural network-based model was then designed and fit to the dataset. Its error rate was then assessed on an exterior test dataset and compared to the current state-of-the-art (ie, the Iris software). Statistical significance of the proposed approach's superiority was assessed via bootstrap.
RESULTS: The proposed approach resulted in a test accuracy of 97.8% (95% CI 97.7-97.9), which constitutes a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art and its accuracy of 74.5% (95% CI 74.0-75.0) assessed on the same test example. Such an improvement opens up a whole field of new applications, from nosologist-level batch-automated coding to international and temporal harmonization of cause of death statistics. A typical example of such an application is demonstrated by recoding French overdose-related deaths from 2000 to 2010.
CONCLUSIONS: This article shows that deep artificial neural networks are perfectly suited to the analysis of electronic health records and can learn a complex set of medical rules directly from voluminous datasets, without any explicit prior knowledge. Although not entirely free from mistakes, the derived algorithm constitutes a powerful decision-making tool that is able to handle structured medical data with an unprecedented performance. We strongly believe that the methods developed in this article are highly reusable in a variety of settings related to epidemiology, biostatistics, and the medical sciences in general.",0.1034195381470085,other,Unknown

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance and generalizability of a deep neural network for colorectal polyp classification on histopathologic slide images using a multi-institutional data set.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study used histopathologic slides collected from January 1, 2016, to June 31, 2016, from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, with 326 slides used for training, 157 slides for an internal data set, and 25 for a validation set. For the external data set, 238 slides for 179 distinct patients were obtained from 24 institutions across 13 US states. Data analysis was performed from April 9 to November 23, 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model to classify 4 major colorectal polyp types: tubular adenoma, tubulovillous or villous adenoma, hyperplastic polyp, and sessile serrated adenoma. Performance was compared with that of local pathologists' at the point of care identified from corresponding pathology laboratories.
RESULTS: For the internal evaluation on the 157 slides with ground truth labels from 5 pathologists, the deep neural network had a mean accuracy of 93.5% (95% CI, 89.6%-97.4%) compared with local pathologists' accuracy of 91.4% (95% CI, 87.0%-95.8%).

The purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning model which predicted atherosclerosis by using retinal fundus images and to verify its clinical implications by conducting a retrospective cohort analysis.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: The database at the Health Promotion Center of Seoul National University Hospital (HPC-SNUH) was used. The deep learning model was trained using 15,408 images to predict carotid artery atherosclerosis, which was named the deep-learning funduscopic atherosclerosis score (DL-FAS). A retrospective cohort was constructed of participants 30-80 years old who had completed elective health examinations at HPC-SNUH. Using DL-FAS as the main exposure, participants were followed for the primary outcome of death due to CVD until Dec. 31, 2017.
RESULTS: For predicting carotid artery atherosclerosis among subjects, the model achieved an area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 0.713, 0.569, 0.583, 0.891, 0.404, 0.465, and 0.865 respectively. The cohort consisted of 32,227 participants, 78 cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths, and 7.6-year median follow-up visits. Those with DL-FAS greater than 0.66 had an increased risk of CVD deaths compared to those with DL-FAS <0.33 (hazard ratio: 8.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.16-24.7). Risk association was significant among intermediate and high Framingham risk score (FRS) subgroups. The DL-FAS improved the concordance by 0.0266 (95% CI, 0.0043-0.0489) over the FRS-only model. The relative integrated discrimination index was 20.45% and net reclassification index was 29.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning model was developed which could predict atherosclerosis from retinal fundus images. The resulting DL-FAS was an independent predictor of CVD deaths when adjusted for FRS and added predictive value over FRS.",0.14988991491940917,computer vision,Unknown

Traditional analyses that associate DNAm alterations with phenotypes suffer from multiple hypothesis testing and multi-collinearity due to the high-dimensional, continuous, interacting and non-linear nature of the data. Deep learning analyses have shown much promise to study disease heterogeneity. DNAm deep learning approaches have not yet been formalized into user-friendly frameworks for execution, training, and interpreting models. Here, we describe MethylNet, a DNAm deep learning method that can construct embeddings, make predictions, generate new data, and uncover unknown heterogeneity with minimal user supervision.
RESULTS: The results of our experiments indicate that MethylNet can study cellular differences, grasp higher order information of cancer sub-types, estimate age and capture factors associated with smoking in concordance with known differences.

Accurate survival analysis is urgently needed for better disease diagnosis and treatment management.
RESULTS: In this work, we propose a survival analysis system that takes advantage of recently emerging deep learning techniques. The proposed system consists of three major components. 1) The first component is an end-to-end cellular feature learning module using a deep neural network with global average pooling. The learned cellular representations encode high-level biologically relevant information without requiring individual cell segmentation, which is aggregated into patient-level feature vectors by using a locality-constrained linear coding (LLC)-based bag of words (BoW) encoding algorithm. 2) The second component is a Cox proportional hazards model with an elastic net penalty for robust feature selection and survival analysis. 3) The third commponent is a biomarker interpretation module that can help localize the image regions that contribute to the survival model's decision. Extensive experiments show that the proposed survival model has excellent predictive power for a public (i.e., The Cancer Genome Atlas) lung cancer dataset in terms of two commonly used metrics: log-rank test (p-value) of the Kaplan-Meier estimate and concordance index (c-index).
CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we have proposed a segmentation-free survival analysis system that takes advantage of the recently emerging deep learning framework and well-studied survival analysis methods such as the Cox proportional hazards model.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this study, we used two deep-learning algorithms based on whole-slide digitized histological slides (whole-slide imaging; WSI) to build models for predicting survival of patients with HCC treated by surgical resection. Two independent series were investigated: a discovery set (Henri Mondor Hospital, n = 194) used to develop our algorithms and an independent validation set (The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA], n = 328). WSIs were first divided into small squares (""tiles""), and features were extracted with a pretrained convolutional neural network (preprocessing step). The first deep-learning-based algorithm (""SCHMOWDER"") uses an attention mechanism on tumoral areas annotated by a pathologist whereas the second (""CHOWDER"") does not require human expertise. In the discovery set, c-indices for survival prediction of SCHMOWDER and CHOWDER reached 0.78 and 0.75, respectively. Both models outperformed a composite score incorporating all baseline variables associated with survival. Prognostic value of the models was further validated in the TCGA data set, and, as observed in the discovery series, both models had a higher discriminatory power than a score combining all baseline variables associated with survival. Pathological review showed that the tumoral areas most predictive of poor survival were characterized by vascular spaces, the macrotrabecular architectural pattern, and a lack of immune infiltration.

Clinically acquired computed tomography (CT) scans are commonly used for quantification of body composition, but manual analysis is laborious and costly. The primary aim of this study was to develop an automated body composition analysis framework using CT scans.
METHODS: CT scans of the 3rd lumbar vertebrae from critically ill, liver cirrhosis, pancreatic cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients, as well as renal and liver donors, were manually analyzed for body composition. Ninety percent of scans were used for developing and validating a neural network for the automated segmentation of skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. Network accuracy was evaluated with the remaining 10 percent of scans using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), which quantifies the overlap (0 = no overlap, 1 = perfect overlap) between human and automated segmentations.
RESULTS: Of the 893 patients, 44% were female, with a mean (±SD) age and body mass index of 52.7 (±15.8) years old and 28.0 (±6.1) kg/m2, respectively. In the testing cohort (n = 89), DSC scores indicated excellent agreement between human and network-predicted segmentations for skeletal muscle (0.983 ± 0.013), and intermuscular (0.900 ± 0.034), visceral (0.979 ± 0.019), and subcutaneous (0.986 ± 0.016) adipose tissue.

RESULTS: We propose a novel biologically interpretable pathway-based sparse deep neural network, named Cox-PASNet, which integrates high-dimensional gene expression data and clinical data on a simple neural network architecture for survival analysis. Cox-PASNet is biologically interpretable where nodes in the neural network correspond to biological genes and pathways, while capturing the nonlinear and hierarchical effects of biological pathways associated with cancer patient survival. We also propose a heuristic optimization solution to train Cox-PASNet with HDLSS data.

Moreover, the neural network architecture of Cox-PASNet was biologically interpreted, and several significant prognostic factors of genes and biological pathways were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Cox-PASNet models biological mechanisms in the neural network by incorporating biological pathway databases and sparse coding. The neural network of Cox-PASNet can identify nonlinear and hierarchical associations of genomic and clinical data to cancer patient survival.

Advances in DNA sequencing technology have enabled rapid metagenomic analyses of viruses, but the prediction of virus phenotype from genome sequences is an active area of research. As such, automatic prediction of host tropism from analysis of genomic information is of considerable utility. Previous research has applied machine learning methods to accomplish this task, although deep learning (particularly deep convolutional neural network, CNN) techniques have not yet been applied. These techniques have the ability to learn how to recognize critical hierarchical structures within the genome in a data-driven manner. We designed deep CNN models to identify host tropism for human and avian influenza A viruses based on protein sequences and performed a detailed analysis of the results. Our findings show that deep CNN techniques work as well as existing approaches (with 99% mean accuracy on the binary prediction task) while performing end-to-end learning of the prediction model (without the need to specify handcrafted features). The findings also show that these models, combined with standard principal component analysis, can be used to quantify and visualize viral strain similarity.",0.1900783032575388,computer vision,"CNN, principal component analysis"

As new chemo-, targeted molecular, and immune therapies emerge and show promising results in clinical trials, image-based methods for early prediction of treatment response are needed. Deep learning models that incorporate radiomics features promise to extract information from brain MR imaging that correlates with response and prognosis. We report initial production of a combined deep learning and radiomics model to predict overall survival in a clinically heterogeneous cohort of patients with high-grade gliomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with high-grade gliomas from our hospital and 128 patients with high-grade glioma from The Cancer Genome Atlas were included. For each patient, we calculated 348 hand-crafted radiomics features and 8192 deep features generated by a pretrained convolutional neural network. We then applied feature selection and Elastic Net-Cox modeling to differentiate patients into long- and short-term survivors.
RESULTS: In the 50 patients with high-grade gliomas from our institution, the combined feature analysis framework classified the patients into long- and short-term survivor groups with a log-rank test P value &lt; .001. In the 128 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas, the framework classified patients into long- and short-term survivors with a log-rank test P value of .014. For the mixed cohort of 50 patients from our institution and 58 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas, it yielded a log-rank test P value of .035.

Each type of -omics data corresponds to one feature space, such as gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation, etc. Integrating multi-omics data can link different layers of molecular feature spaces and is crucial to elucidate molecular pathways underlying various diseases. Machine learning approaches to mining multi-omics data hold great promises in uncovering intricate relationships among molecular features. However, due to the ""big p, small n"" problem (i.e., small sample sizes with high-dimensional features), training a large-scale generalizable deep learning model with multi-omics data alone is very challenging.
RESULTS: We developed a method called Multi-view Factorization AutoEncoder (MAE) with network constraints that can seamlessly integrate multi-omics data and domain knowledge such as molecular interaction networks. Our method learns feature and patient embeddings simultaneously with deep representation learning. Both feature representations and patient representations are subject to certain constraints specified as regularization terms in the training objective. By incorporating domain knowledge into the training objective, we implicitly introduced a good inductive bias into the machine learning model, which helps improve model generalizability. We performed extensive experiments on the TCGA datasets and demonstrated the power of integrating multi-omics data and biological interaction networks using our proposed method for predicting target clinical variables.
CONCLUSIONS: To alleviate the overfitting problem in deep learning on multi-omics data with the ""big p, small n"" problem, it is helpful to incorporate biological domain knowledge into the model as inductive biases. It is very promising to design machine learning models that facilitate the seamless integration of large-scale multi-omics data and biomedical domain knowledge for uncovering intricate relationships among molecular features and clinical features.",0.12862332116826788,other,AutoEncoder

We developed a novel hybrid deep learning model to efficiently integrate an entire set of dosimetric parameters of a radiation treatment plan with a patient's pre- and mid-treatment information to improve the prediction of grade 4 radiotherapy-induced lymphopenia. We proposed a two-input channel hybrid deep learning model to process dosimetric information using a stacked bi-directional long-short term memory structure and non-dosimetric information using a multilayer perceptron structure independently before integrating the dosimetric and non-dosimetric information for final prediction. The model was trained from 505 patients and tested in 216 patients. We compared our model with other popular predictive models, including logistic regression (with and without elastic-net regularization) random forest, support vector machines, and artificial neural network. Our hybrid deep learning model out-performed other predictive models in various evaluation metrics. It achieved the highest area under the curve at 0.831, accuracy at 0.769, F1 score at 0.631, precision at 0.670, and recall at 0.610. The hybrid deep learning model also demonstrated robustness in exploiting the value of dosimetric parameters in predictive modeling.

Treatment recommendations are predictions with an inherently causal interpretation. To use deep learning for these applications in the setting of observational data, deep learning methods must be made compatible with the required causal assumptions. We present a scenario with real-world medical images (CT-scans of lung cancer) and simulated outcome data. Through the data simulation scheme, the images contain two distinct factors of variation that are associated with survival, but represent a collider (tumor size) and a prognostic factor (tumor heterogeneity), respectively. When a deep network would use all the information available in the image to predict survival, it would condition on the collider and thereby introduce bias in the estimation of the treatment effect. We show that when this collider can be quantified, unbiased individual prognosis predictions are attainable with deep learning. This is achieved by (1) setting a dual task for the network to predict both the outcome and the collider and (2) enforcing a form of linear independence of the activation distributions of the last layer. Our method provides an example of combining deep learning and structural causal models to achieve unbiased individual prognosis predictions. Extensions of machine learning methods for applications to causal questions are required to attain the long-standing goal of personalized medicine supported by artificial intelligence.",0.2686242174336848,computer vision,Unknown

Moreover, it is not easy to diagnose CHD at the earlier stage; hospitals diagnose it based on various types of medical tests. Thus, by predicting high-risk people who are to suffer from CHD, it is significant to reduce the risks of developing CHD. In recent years, some research works have been done using data mining to predict the risk of developing diseases based on medical tests. In this study, we have proposed a reconstruction error (RE) based deep neural networks (DNNs); this approach uses a deep autoencoder (AE) model for estimating RE. Initially, a training dataset is divided into two groups by their RE divergence on the deep AE model that learned from the whole training dataset. Next, two DNN classifiers are trained on each group of datasets separately by combining a RE based new feature with other risk factors to predict the risk of developing CHD. For creating the new feature, we use deep AE model that trained on the only high-risk dataset. We have performed an experiment to prove how the components of our proposed method work together more efficiently. As a result of our experiment, the performance measurements include accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and AUC score reached 86.3371%, 91.3716%, 82.9024%, 86.9148%, and 86.6568%, respectively.

Clinical variables and radiological image biomarkers (old age, pre-stroke mRS, NIHSS, occlusion location, ASPECTS, among others) have an important role in treatment selection and prognosis. Radiological biomarkers require expert annotation and are subject to inter-observer variability. Recently, Deep Learning has been introduced to reproduce these radiological image biomarkers. Instead of reproducing these biomarkers, in this work, we investigated Deep Learning techniques for building models to directly predict good reperfusion after endovascular treatment (EVT) and good functional outcome using CT angiography images. These models do not require image annotation and are fast to compute. We compare the Deep Learning models to Machine Learning models using traditional radiological image biomarkers. We explored Residual Neural Network (ResNet) architectures, adapted them with Structured Receptive Fields (RFNN) and auto-encoders (AE) for network weight initialization. We further included model visualization techniques to provide insight into the network's decision-making process. We applied the methods on the MR CLEAN Registry dataset with 1301 patients. The Deep Learning models outperformed the models using traditional radiological image biomarkers in three out of four cross-validation folds for functional outcome (average AUC of 0.71) and for all folds for reperfusion (average AUC of 0.65). Model visualization showed that the arteries were relevant features for functional outcome prediction. The best results were obtained for the ResNet models with RFNN.

The diagnosis and treatment information of breast cancer patients is abundant in multiple types of clinical fields, including clinicopathological data, genotype and phenotype information, treatment information, and prognosis information. However, current studies are mainly focused on extracting information from one specific type of clinical field. This study defines a comprehensive information model to represent the whole-course clinical information of patients. Furthermore, deep learning approaches are used to extract the concepts and their attributes from clinical breast cancer documents by fine-tuning pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical corpus that was used in this study was from one 3A cancer hospital in China, consisting of the encounter notes, operation records, pathology notes, radiology notes, progress notes and discharge summaries of 100 breast cancer patients. Our system consists of two components: a named entity recognition (NER) component and a relation recognition component. For each component, we implemented deep learning-based approaches by fine-tuning BERT, which outperformed other state-of-the-art methods on multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks. A clinical language model is first pretrained using BERT on a large-scale unlabeled corpus of Chinese clinical text. For NER, the context embeddings that were pretrained using BERT were used as the input features of the Bi-LSTM-CRF (Bidirectional long-short-memory-conditional random fields) model and were fine-tuned using the annotated breast cancer notes. Furthermore, we proposed an approach to fine-tune BERT for relation extraction. It was considered to be a classification problem in which the two entities that were mentioned in the input sentence were replaced with their semantic types.
RESULTS: Our best-performing system achieved F1 scores of 93.53% for the NER and 96.73% for the relation extraction. Additional evaluations showed that the deep learning-based approaches that fine-tuned BERT did outperform the traditional Bi-LSTM-CRF and CRF machine learning algorithms in NER and the attention-Bi-LSTM and SVM (support vector machines) algorithms in relation recognition.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed a deep learning approach that fine-tuned BERT to extract the breast cancer concepts and their attributes.

The currently available prediction tools using summaries of intraoperative data are limited by their inability to reflect shifting risk associated with intraoperative physiological perturbations. We sought to compare similar benchmarks to a deep-learning algorithm predicting postoperative 30-day mortality.
METHODS: We constructed a multipath convolutional neural network model using patient characteristics, co-morbid conditions, preoperative laboratory values, and intraoperative numerical data from patients undergoing surgery with tracheal intubation at a single medical centre. Data for 60 min prior to a randomly selected time point were utilised. Model performance was compared with a deep neural network, a random forest, a support vector machine, and a logistic regression using predetermined summary statistics of intraoperative data.
RESULTS: Of 95 907 patients, 941 (1%) died within 30 days. The multipath convolutional neural network predicted postoperative 30-day mortality with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.867 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.835-0.899).

Random forests methods have shown promise in speeding up this process, but they lag behind human classification accuracy by about 5%. We explore whether more recently available document classification algorithms can close this gap.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data gathered from a single surveillance site, we applied 8 supervised learning algorithms to predict whether children meet the case definition for ASD based solely on the words in their evaluations. We compared the algorithms' performance across 10 random train-test splits of the data, using classification accuracy, F1 score, and number of positive calls to evaluate their potential use for surveillance.
RESULTS: Across the 10 train-test cycles, the random forest and support vector machine with Naive Bayes features (NB-SVM) each achieved slightly more than 87% mean accuracy. The NB-SVM produced significantly more false negatives than false positives (P = 0.027), but the random forest did not, making its prevalence estimates very close to the true prevalence in the data. The best-performing neural network performed similarly to the random forest on both measures.
DISCUSSION: The random forest performed as well as more recently available models like the NB-SVM and the neural network, and it also produced good prevalence estimates. NB-SVM may not be a good candidate for use in a fully-automated surveillance workflow due to increased false negatives. More sophisticated algorithms, like hierarchical convolutional neural networks, may not be feasible to train due to characteristics of the data. Current algorithms might perform better if the data are abstracted and processed differently and if they take into account information about the children in addition to their evaluations.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning models performed similarly to traditional machine learning methods at predicting the clinician-assigned case status for CDC's autism surveillance system. While deep learning methods had limited benefit in this task, they may have applications in other surveillance systems.",0.10374291666226058,computer vision,"random forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, support vector machine"

For improved accuracy of CVD prediction, risk classification was performed using national time-series health examination data. The data offers an opportunity to access deep learning (RNN-LSTM), which is widely known as an outstanding algorithm for analyzing time-series datasets. The objective of this study was to show the improved accuracy of deep learning by comparing the performance of a Cox hazard regression and RNN-LSTM based on survival analysis.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We selected 361,239 subjects (age 40 to 79 years) with more than two health examination records from 2002-2006 using the National Health Insurance System-National Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS). The average number of health screenings (from 2002-2013) used in the analysis was 2.9 ± 1.0. Two CVD prediction models were developed from the NHIS-HEALS data: a Cox hazard regression model and a deep learning model. In an internal validation of the NHIS-HEALS dataset, the Cox regression model showed a highest time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.87) for in females and 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.80) in males at 2 years. The deep learning model showed a highest time-dependent AUC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.97) for in females and 0.96 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.97) in males at 2 years. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) revealed that age was the variable that had the greatest effect on CVD, followed by systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), in that order.
CONCLUSION: The performance of the deep learning model for predicting CVD occurrences was better than that of the Cox regression model. In addition, it was confirmed that the known risk factors shown to be important by previous clinical studies were extracted from the study results using LRP.",0.19114154635984304,other,"LSTM, RNN"

As per the World Health Organization, India has the highest number of pre-term births [1], with over 3.5 million babies born prematurely, and up to 40% of them are babies with low birth weights, highly prone to a multitude of diseases such as Jaundice, Sepsis, Apnea, and other Metabolic disorders. Apnea is the primary concern for caretakers of neonates in intensive care units. The real-time medical data is known to be noisy and nonlinear and to address the resultant complexity in classification and prediction of diseases; there is a need for optimizing learning models to maximize predictive performance. Our study attempts to optimize neural network architectures to predict the occurrence of apneic episodes in neonates, after the first week of admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The primary contribution of this study is the formulation and description of a set of generic steps involved in selecting various model-specific, training and hyper-parametric optimization algorithms, as well as model architectures for optimal predictive performance on complex and noisy medical datasets.
METHODS: The data used for the study being inherently complex and noisy, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce dataset dimensionality for the analysis such as interpretations and visualization of the dataset. Hyper-parametric and parametric optimization, in different categories, are considered, including learning rate updater algorithms, regularization methods, activation functions, gradient descent algorithms and depth of the network, based on their performance on the validation set, to obtain a holistically optimized neural network, that best model the given complex medical dataset. Deep Neural Network Architectures such as Deep Multilayer Perceptron's, Stacked Auto-encoders and Deep Belief Networks are employed to model the dataset, and their performance is compared to the optimized neural network obtained from the parametric exploration. Further, the results are compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms.
RESULTS: The results indicate that the optimized eight layer Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, with Adam Decay and Stochastic Gradient Descent (AUC 0.82) can outperform the conventional machine learning models, and perform comparably to the Deep Auto-encoder model (AUC 0.83) in predicting the presence of apnea in neonates.
CONCLUSION: The study shows that an MLP model can undergo significant improvements in predictive performance, by the proposed step-wise optimization. The optimized MLP is proved to be as accurate as deep neural network models such as Deep Belief Networks and Deep Auto-encoders for noisy and nonlinear data sets, and outperform all conventional models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), K Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. The generic nature of the proposed step-wise optimization provides a framework to optimize neural networks on such complex nonlinear datasets.

Epub 2019 Jul 4.,Oh J,J Affect Disord,2019,2019/07/30,,,10.1016/j.jad.2019.06.034,"BACKGROUND: As depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, large-scale surveys have been conducted to establish the occurrence and risk factors of depression. However, accurately estimating epidemiological factors leading up to depression has remained challenging. Deep-learning algorithms can be applied to assess the factors leading up to prevalence and clinical manifestations of depression.
METHODS: Customized deep-neural-network and machine-learning classifiers were assessed using survey data from 19,725 participants from the NHANES database (from 1999 through 2014) and 4949 from the South Korea NHANES (K-NHANES) database in 2014.
RESULTS: A deep-learning algorithm showed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.91 and 0.89 for detecting depression in NHANES and K-NHANES, respectively. The deep-learning algorithm trained with serial datasets (NHANES, from 1999 to 2012), predicted the prevalence of depression in the following two years of data (NHANES, 2013 and 2014) with an AUC of 0.92. Machine learning classifiers trained with NHANES could further predict depression in K-NHANES. There, logistic regression had the highest performance (AUC, 0.77) followed by deep learning algorithm (AUC, 0.74).
CONCLUSIONS: Deep neural-networks managed to identify depression well from other health and demographic factors in both the NHANES and K-NHANES datasets. The deep-learning algorithm was also able to predict depression relatively well on new data set-cross temporally and cross nationally. Further research can delineate the clinical implications of machine learning and deep learning in detecting disease prevalence and progress as well as other risk factors for depression and other mental illnesses.",0.25163681355455236,other,logistic regression

Recently, a deep learning approach has shown promising results in a variety of research areas. However, applying the deep learning approach requires expertise for constructing a deep architecture that can take multimodal longitudinal data. Thus, in this paper, a deep learning-based python package for data integration is developed. The python package deep learning-based multimodal longitudinal data integration framework (MildInt) provides the preconstructed deep learning architecture for a classification task. MildInt contains two learning phases: learning feature representation from each modality of data and training a classifier for the final decision. Adopting deep architecture in the first phase leads to learning more task-relevant feature representation than a linear model. In the second phase, linear regression classifier is used for detecting and investigating biomarkers from multimodal data. Thus, by combining the linear model and the deep learning model, higher accuracy and better interpretability can be achieved. We validated the performance of our package using simulation data and real data. For the real data, as a pilot study, we used clinical and multimodal neuroimaging datasets in Alzheimer's disease to predict the disease progression. MildInt is capable of integrating multiple forms of numerical data including time series and non-time series data for extracting complementary features from the multimodal dataset.",0.351087812140309,other,linear regression

Accurate quantitative analysis of microvessels is helpful for the development of a targeted therapy for antiangiogenesis. The deep-learning algorithm is by far the most effective segmentation and detection model and enables location and recognition of complex microvascular networks in large images obtained from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained specimens. We proposed an automated deep-learning-based method to detect and quantify the microvascularity in glioma and applied it to comprehensive clinical analyses. A total of 350 glioma patients were enrolled in our study, for which digitalized imaging of H&E stained slides were reviewed, molecular diagnosis was performed and follow-up was investigated. The microvascular features were compared according to their histologic types, molecular types, and patients' prognosis. The results show that the proposed method can quantify microvascular characteristics automatically and effectively. Significant increases of microvascular density and microvascular area were observed in glioblastomas (95% p < 0.001 in density, 170% p < 0.001 in area) in comparison with other histologic types; increases were also observed in cases with TERT-mut only (68% p < 0.001 in density, 54% p < 0.001 in area) compared with other molecular types. Survival analysis showed that microvascular features can be used to cluster cases into two groups with different survival periods (hazard ratio [HR] 2.843, log-rank <0.001), which indicates the quantified microvascular features may potentially be alternative signatures for revealing patients' prognosis. This deep-learning-based method may be a useful tool in routine clinical practice for precise diagnosis and antiangiogenic treatment.",0.11943248890481628,computer vision,Unknown

Previous studies and news investigations have reported the use of popular social media platforms as conduits for opioid sales. This study uses deep learning to detect illicit drug dealing on the image and video sharing platform Instagram.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a machine learning approach to detect Instagram posts related to illegal internet drug dealing.
METHODS: In this paper, we describe an approach to detect drug dealers by using a deep learning model on Instagram. We collected Instagram posts using a Web scraper between July 2018 and October 2018 and then compared our deep learning model against 3 different machine learning models (eg, random forest, decision tree, and support vector machine) to assess the performance and accuracy of the model. For our deep learning model, we used the long short-term memory unit in the recurrent neural network to learn the pattern of the text of drug dealing posts. We also manually annotated all posts collected to evaluate our model performance and to characterize drug selling conversations.
RESULTS: From the 12,857 posts we collected, we detected 1228 drug dealer posts comprising 267 unique users. We used cross-validation to evaluate the 4 models, with our deep learning model reaching 95% on F1 score and performing better than the other 3 models. We also found that by removing the hashtags in the text, the model had better performance. Detected posts contained hashtags related to several drugs, including the controlled substance Xanax (1078/1228, 87.78%), oxycodone/OxyContin (321/1228, 26.14%), and illicit drugs lysergic acid diethylamide (213/1228, 17.34%) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (94/1228, 7.65%). We also observed the use of communication applications for suspected drug trading through user comments.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach using a combination of Web scraping and deep learning was able to detect illegal online drug sellers on Instagram, with high accuracy. Despite increased scrutiny by regulators and policymakers, the Instagram platform continues to host posts from drug dealers, in violation of federal law. Further action needs to be taken to ensure the safety of social media communities and help put an end to this illicit digital channel of sourcing.",0.1673379808920239,computer vision,"random forest, decision tree, support vector machine"

A deep-learning model that enables noninvasive hyperkalemia screening from the electrocardiogram (ECG) may improve detection of this life-threatening condition.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a deep-learning model in detection of hyperkalemia from the ECG in patients with CKD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A deep convolutional neural network (DNN) was trained using 1 576 581 ECGs from 449 380 patients seen at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from 1994 to 2017. The DNN was trained using 2 (leads I and II) or 4 (leads I, II, V3, and V5) ECG leads to detect serum potassium levels of 5.5 mEq/L or less (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1) and was validated using retrospective data from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona. The validation included 61 965 patients with stage 3 or greater CKD. Each patient had a serum potassium count drawn within 4 hours after their ECG was recorded. Data were analyzed between April 12, 2018, and June 25, 2018.
EXPOSURES: Use of a deep-learning model.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity, with serum potassium level as the reference standard.

Using a 90% sensitivity operating point, the sensitivity was 90.2% (95% CI, 88.4%-91.7%) and specificity was 63.2% (95% CI, 62.7%-63.6%) for Minnesota; the sensitivity was 91.3% (95% CI, 87.4%-94.3%) and specificity was 54.7% (95% CI, 53.4%-56.0%) for Florida; and the sensitivity was 88.9% (95% CI, 84.5%-92.4%) and specificity was 55.0% (95% CI, 53.7%-56.3%) for Arizona.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, using only 2 ECG leads, a deep-learning model detected hyperkalemia in patients with renal disease with an AUC of 0.853 to 0.883. The application of artificial intelligence to the ECG may enable screening for hyperkalemia. Prospective studies are warranted.",0.13409943823940126,computer vision,Unknown

However, the presence of stroke lesions is usually overlooked by automatic neuroimage processing methods and the-state-of-the-art deep learning schemes, which lack sufficient annotated data. We explore the use of radiomics in identifying whether a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan belongs to an individual that had a stroke or not.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used 1800 3D sets of MRI data from three prospective studies: one of stroke mechanisms and two of cognitive ageing, evaluated 114 textural features in WMH, cerebrospinal fluid, deep grey and normal-appearing white matter, and attempted to classify the scans using a random forest and support vector machine classifiers with and without feature selection. We evaluated the discriminatory power of each feature independently in each population and corrected the result against Type 1 errors. We also evaluated the influence of clinical parameters in the classification results.
RESULTS: Subtypes of ischaemic strokes (i.e. lacunar vs. cortical) cannot be discerned using radiomics, but the presence of a stroke-type lesion can be ascertained with accuracies ranging from 0.7 < AUC < 0.83. Feature selection, tissue type, stroke subtype and MRI sequence did not seem to determine the classification results. From all clinical variables evaluated, age correlated with the proportion of images classified correctly using either different or the same descriptors (Pearson r = 0.31 and 0.39 respectively, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Texture features in conventionally automatically segmented tissues may help in the identification of the presence of previous stroke lesions on an MRI scan, and should be taken into account in transfer learning strategies of the-state-of-the-art deep learning schemes.",0.12489822906508707,computer vision,"random forest, support vector machine"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the determinants of health in aging using machine learning methods and to compare the accuracy with traditional methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS The health status of 6,209 adults, age <65 years (n=1,585), 65-79 years (n=3,267), and >80 years (n=1,357) were measured using an established health metric (0-100) that incorporated physical function and activities of daily living (ADL). Data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) included socio-economic and sociodemographic characteristics and history of falls. Health-trend and personal-fitted variables were generated as predictors of health metrics using three machine learning methods, random forest (RF), deep learning (DL) and the linear model (LM), with calculation of the percentage increase in mean square error (%IncMSE) as a measure of the importance of a given predictive variable, when the variable was removed from the model. RESULTS Health-trend, physical activity, and personal-fitted variables were the main predictors of health, with the%incMSE of 85.76%, 63.40%, and 46.71%, respectively. Age, employment status, alcohol consumption, and household income had the%incMSE of 20.40%, 20.10%, 16.94%, and 13.61%, respectively. Performance of the RF method was similar to the traditional LM (p=0.7), but RF significantly outperformed DL (p=0.006).

This study proposes a novel neural network based paradigm for accurate prediction of liver SBRT outcomes. We assembled a database of patients treated with liver SBRT at our institution. Together with a three-dimensional (3-D) dose delivery plans for each SBRT treatment, other variables such as patients' demographics, quantified abdominal anatomy, history of liver comorbidities, other liver-directed therapies, and liver function tests were collected. We developed a multi-path neural network with the convolutional path for 3-D dose plan analysis and fully connected path for other variables analysis, where the network was trained to predict post-SBRT survival and local cancer progression. To enhance the network robustness, it was initially pre-trained on a large database of computed tomography images. Following n-fold cross-validation, the network automatically identified patients that are likely to have longer survival or late cancer recurrence, i.e., patients with the positive predicted outcome (PPO) of SBRT, and vice versa, i.e., negative predicted outcome (NPO). The predicted results agreed with actual SBRT outcomes with 56% of PPO patients and 0% NPO patients with primary liver cancer survived more than two years after SBRT. Similarly, 82% of PPO patients and 0% of NPO patients with metastatic liver cancer survived two-year threshold. The obtained results were superior to the performance of support vector machine and random forest classifiers. Furthermore, the network was able to identify the critical-to-spare liver regions, and the critical clinical features associated with the highest risks of negative SBRT outcomes.",0.11800785048003634,computer vision,"random forest, support vector machine"

This study investigates the effects of food contamination on gastrointestinal-disease morbidities using eight different machine-learning models, including multiple linear regression, a shallow neural network, and three deep neural networks and their improved versions trained by an evolutionary algorithm. Experiments on the datasets from ten cities/counties in central China demonstrate that deep neural networks achieve significantly higher accuracy than classical linear-regression and shallow neural-network models, and the deep denoising autoencoder model with evolutionary learning exhibits the best prediction performance. The results also indicate that the prediction accuracies on acute gastrointestinal diseases are generally higher than those on other diseases, but the models are difficult to predict the morbidities of gastrointestinal tumors.

These features give us information about a nodule, for example, nodule size, pixel intensity, histogram-based information, and texture information from wavelets or a convolution kernel. Semantic features, on the other hand, can be generated by an experienced radiologist and consist of the common characteristics of a tumor, for example, location of a tumor, fissure, or pleural wall attachment, presence of fibrosis or emphysema, concave cut on nodule surface. These features have been derived for lung nodules by our group. Semantic features have also shown promise in predicting malignancy. Deep features from images are generally extracted from the last layers before the classification layer of a convolutional neural network (CNN). By training with the use of different types of images, the CNN learns to recognize various patterns and textures. But when we extract deep features, there is no specific naming approach for them, other than denoting them by the feature column number (position of a neuron in a hidden layer). In this study, we tried to relate and explain deep features with respect to traditional quantitative features and semantic features. We discovered that 26 deep features from the Vgg-S neural network and 12 deep features from our trained CNN could be explained by semantic or traditional quantitative features. From this, we concluded that those deep features can have a recognizable definition via semantic or quantitative features.",0.14399198035458574,computer vision,"CNN, Vgg"

Deep learning is a form of ML typically implemented via multi-layered neural networks. Deep learning has accelerated by recent advances in computer hardware and algorithms and is increasingly applied in e-commerce, finance, and voice and image recognition to learn and classify complex datasets. The current medical literature shows both strengths and limitations of DL. Strengths of DL include its ability to automate medical image interpretation, enhance clinical decision-making, identify novel phenotypes, and select better treatment pathways in complex diseases. Deep learning may be well-suited to cardiovascular medicine in which haemodynamic and electrophysiological indices are increasingly captured on a continuous basis by wearable devices as well as image segmentation in cardiac imaging. However, DL also has significant weaknesses including difficulties in interpreting its models (the 'black-box' criticism), its need for extensive adjudicated ('labelled') data in training, lack of standardization in design, lack of data-efficiency in training, limited applicability to clinical trials, and other factors. Thus, the optimal clinical application of DL requires careful formulation of solvable problems, selection of most appropriate DL algorithms and data, and balanced interpretation of results. This review synthesizes the current state of DL for cardiovascular clinicians and investigators, and provides technical context to appreciate the promise, pitfalls, near-term challenges, and opportunities for this exciting new area.",0.19191152763037944,computer vision,Unknown

Accurate pre-operative prognosis for this cohort can lead to better treatment planning. Conventional survival prediction based on clinical information is subjective and could be inaccurate. Recent radiomics studies have shown better prognosis by using carefully-engineered image features from magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, feature engineering is usually time consuming, laborious and subjective. Most importantly, the engineered features cannot effectively encode other predictive but implicit information provided by multi-modal neuroimages. We propose a two-stage learning-based method to predict the overall survival (OS) time of high-grade gliomas patient. At the first stage, we adopt deep learning, a recently dominant technique of artificial intelligence, to automatically extract implicit and high-level features from multi-modal, multi-channel preoperative MRI such that the features are competent of predicting survival time. Specifically, we utilize not only contrast-enhanced T1 MRI, but also diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), for computing multiple metric maps (including various diffusivity metric maps derived from DTI, and also the frequency-specific brain fluctuation amplitude maps and local functional connectivity anisotropy-related metric maps derived from rs-fMRI) from 68 high-grade glioma patients with different survival time. We propose a multi-channel architecture of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for deep learning upon those metric maps, from which high-level predictive features are extracted for each individual patch of these maps. At the second stage, those deeply learned features along with the pivotal limited demographic and tumor-related features (such as age, tumor size and histological type) are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to generate the final prediction result (i.e., long or short overall survival time). The experimental results demonstrate that this multi-model, multi-channel deep survival prediction framework achieves an accuracy of 90.66%, outperforming all the competing methods.

The Cox proportional hazard regression model generally is used based on an assumption of linear association. However, it is likely that, in reality, there are many clinicopathologic features that exhibit a nonlinear association in biomedicine.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the deep-learning neural network model and the Cox proportional hazard regression model in the prediction of survival in women with cervical cancer.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective pilot study of consecutive cases of newly diagnosed stage I-IV cervical cancer from 2000-2014. A total of 40 features that included patient demographics, vital signs, laboratory test results, tumor characteristics, and treatment types were assessed for analysis and grouped into 3 feature sets. The deep-learning neural network model was compared with the Cox proportional hazard regression model and 3 other survival analysis models for progression-free survival and overall survival. Mean absolute error and concordance index were used to assess the performance of these 5 models.
RESULTS: There were 768 women included in the analysis. The median age was 49 years, and the majority were Hispanic (71.7%). The majority of tumors were squamous (75.3%) and stage I (48.7%). The median follow-up time was 40.2 months; there were 241 events for recurrence and progression and 170 deaths during the follow-up period. The deep-learning model showed promising results in the prediction of progression-free survival when compared with the Cox proportional hazard regression model (mean absolute error, 29.3 vs 316.2). The deep-learning model also outperformed all the other models, including the Cox proportional hazard regression model, for overall survival (mean absolute error, Cox proportional hazard regression vs deep-learning, 43.6 vs 30.7). The performance of the deep-learning model further improved when more features were included (concordance index for progression-free survival: 0.695 for 20 features, 0.787 for 36 features, and 0.795 for 40 features). There were 10 features for progression-free survival and 3 features for overall survival that demonstrated significance only in the deep-learning model, but not in the Cox proportional hazard regression model. There were no features for progression-free survival and 3 features for overall survival that demonstrated significance only in the Cox proportional hazard regression model, but not in the deep-learning model.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the deep-learning neural network model may be a useful analytic tool for survival prediction in women with cervical cancer because it exhibited superior performance compared with the Cox proportional hazard regression model. This novel analytic approach may provide clinicians with meaningful survival information that potentially could be integrated into treatment decision-making and planning. Further validation studies are necessary to support this pilot study.",0.22370309337284766,other,Unknown

METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, the subjects were admitted adult (age ≥ 18 years) HD patients who underwent echocardiography. The outcome was in-hospital mortality. We extracted predictor variables from echocardiography reports using text mining. We developed deep learning-based prediction model using derivation data of a hospital A. And we conducted external validation using echocardiography report of hospital B. We conducted subgroup analysis of coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF) patients of hospital B and compared DL with the currently used predictive models (eg, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction score (TIMI), Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) score, and Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) score).

This study explores deep learning applications in medical imaging allowing for the automated quantification of radiographic characteristics and potentially improving patient stratification.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed an integrative analysis on 7 independent datasets across 5 institutions totaling 1,194 NSCLC patients (age median = 68.3 years [range 32.5-93.3], survival median = 1.7 years [range 0.0-11.7]). Using external validation in computed tomography (CT) data, we identified prognostic signatures using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for patients treated with radiotherapy (n = 771, age median = 68.0 years [range 32.5-93.3], survival median = 1.3 years [range 0.0-11.7]). We then employed a transfer learning approach to achieve the same for surgery patients (n = 391, age median = 69.1 years [range 37.2-88.0], survival median = 3.1 years [range 0.0-8.8]). We found that the CNN predictions were significantly associated with 2-year overall survival from the start of respective treatment for radiotherapy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.70 [95% CI 0.63-0.78], p < 0.001) and surgery (AUC = 0.71 [95% CI 0.60-0.82], p < 0.001) patients. The CNN was also able to significantly stratify patients into low and high mortality risk groups in both the radiotherapy (p < 0.001) and surgery (p = 0.03) datasets. Additionally, the CNN was found to significantly outperform random forest models built on clinical parameters-including age, sex, and tumor node metastasis stage-as well as demonstrate high robustness against test-retest (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.91) and inter-reader (Spearman's rank-order correlation = 0.88) variations. To gain a better understanding of the characteristics captured by the CNN, we identified regions with the most contribution towards predictions and highlighted the importance of tumor-surrounding tissue in patient stratification. We also present preliminary findings on the biological basis of the captured phenotypes as being linked to cell cycle and transcriptional processes. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this study as well as the opaque black box nature of deep learning networks.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of deep transfer learning techniques to classify kidneys of normal children and those with CAKUT.
STUDY DESIGN: A transfer learning method was developed to extract features of kidneys from ultrasound images obtained during routine clinical care of 50 children with CAKUT and 50 controls. To classify diseased and normal kidneys, support vector machine classifiers were built on the extracted features using (1) transfer learning imaging features from a pretrained deep learning model, (2) conventional imaging features, and (3) their combination. These classifiers were compared, and their diagnosis performance was measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.
RESULTS: The AUC for classifiers built on the combination features were 0.92, 0.88, and 0.92 for discriminating the left, right, and bilateral abnormal kidney scans from controls with classification rates of 84%, 81%, and 87%; specificity of 84%, 74%, and 88%; and sensitivity of 85%, 88%, and 86%, respectively. These classifiers performed better than classifiers built on either the transfer learning features or the conventional features alone (p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: The present study validated transfer learning techniques for imaging feature extraction of ultrasound images to build classifiers for distinguishing children with CAKUT from controls. The experiments have demonstrated that the classifiers built on the transfer learning features and conventional image features could distinguish abnormal kidney images from controls with AUCs greater than 0.88, indicating that classification of ultrasound kidney scans has a great potential to aid kidney disease diagnosis. A limitation of the present study is the moderate number of patients that contributed data to the transfer learning approach.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of transfer learning and conventional imaging features yielded the best classification performance for distinguishing children with CAKUT from controls based on ultrasound images of kidneys.",0.12954571175100096,computer vision,support vector machine

Here we assess the screening potential of this scoring system by determining its ability to detect all components of ROP diagnosis.
METHODS: Clinical examination and fundus photography were performed at seven participating centres. A deep learning system was trained to detect plus disease, generating a quantitative assessment of retinal vascular abnormality (the i-ROP plus score) on a 1-9 scale. Overall ROP disease category was established using a consensus reference standard diagnosis combining clinical and image-based diagnosis. Experts then ranked ordered a second data set of 100 posterior images according to overall ROP severity.
RESULTS: 4861 examinations from 870 infants were analysed. 155 examinations (3%) had a reference standard diagnosis of type 1 ROP. The i-ROP deep learning (DL) vascular severity score had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.960 for detecting type 1 ROP. Establishing a threshold i-ROP DL score of 3 conferred 94% sensitivity, 79% specificity, 13% positive predictive value and 99.7% negative predictive value for type 1 ROP. There was strong correlation between expert rank ordering of overall ROP severity and the i-ROP DL vascular severity score (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.93; p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The i-ROP DL system accurately identifies diagnostic categories and overall disease severity in an automated fashion, after being trained only on posterior pole vascular morphology. These data provide proof of concept that a deep learning screening platform could improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and accessibility of screening.",0.10799685812374485,computer vision,Unknown

Individualized prediction tools that are derived from center- or even surgeon-specific data could provide valuable insights for shared decision-making.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of deriving robust deep learning-based predictive analytics from single-center, single-surgeon data.
STUDY DESIGN: Derivation of predictive models from a prospective registry.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients who underwent single-level tubular microdiscectomy for lumbar disc herniation.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Numeric rating scales for leg and back pain severity and Oswestry Disability Index scores at 12 months postoperatively.
METHODS: Data were derived from a prospective registry. We trained deep neural network-based and logistic regression-based prediction models for patient-reported outcome measures. The primary endpoint was achievement of the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in numeric rating scales and Oswestry Disability Index, defined as a 30% or greater improvement from baseline. Univariate predictors of MCID were also identified using conventional statistics.
RESULTS: A total of 422 patients were included (mean [SD] age: 48.5 [11.5] years; 207 [49%] female). After 1 year, 337 (80%), 219 (52%), and 337 (80%) patients reported a clinically relevant improvement in leg pain, back pain, and functional disability, respectively. The deep learning models predicted MCID with high area-under-the-curve of 0.87, 0.90, and 0.84, as well as accuracy of 85%, 87%, and 75%. The regression models provided inferior performance measures for each of the outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that generating personalized and robust deep learning-based analytics for outcome prediction is feasible even with limited amounts of center-specific data. With prospective validation, the ability to preoperatively and reliably inform patients about the likelihood of symptom improvement could prove useful in patient counselling and shared decision-making.",0.1310989255777676,other,logistic regression

These features have been recently formulated, quantified on a point scale in the context of lung nodules by our group. Certain radiological semantic traits have been shown to extremely predictive of malignancy [26]. Semantic traits observed by a radiologist at examination describe the nodules and the morphology of the lung nodule shape, size, border, attachment to vessel or pleural wall, location and texture etc. Deep features are numeric descriptors often obtained from a convolutional neural network (CNN) which are widely used for classification and recognition. Deep features may contain information about texture and shape, primarily. Lately, with the advancement of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are also being used to analyze lung nodules. In this study, we relate deep features to semantic features by looking for similarity in ability to classify. Deep features were obtained using a transfer learning approach from both an ImageNet pre-trained CNN and our trained CNN architecture. We found that some of the semantic features can be represented by one or more deep features. In this process, we can infer that some deep feature(s) have similar discriminatory ability as semantic features.",0.2181480084612318,computer vision,CNN

We expected to predict survival of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) with machine learning, and compared it with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Methods: Data of PNETs cases were extracted from The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database. Statistic description, multivariate survival analysis and preprocessing were done before machine learning. Four different algorithms (logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF) and deep learning (DL)) were used to train the model. We used proper imputations to manage missing data in the database and sensitive analysis was performed to evaluate the imputation. The model with the best predictive accuracy was compared with the AJCC staging system using the SEER cases. Results: The four models had similar predictive accuracy with no significant difference existed (p = 0.664). The DL model showed a slightly better predictive accuracy than others (81.6% (± 1.9%)), thus it was used for further comparison with the AJCC staging system and revealed a better performance for PNETs cases in SEER database (Area under receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.87 vs 0.76). The validity of missing data imputation was supported by sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: The models developed with machine learning performed well in survival prediction of PNETs, and the DL model have a better accuracy and specificity than the AJCC staging system in SEER data.

Automated quantification of EPVS would greatly help to advance research into its etiology and its potential as a risk indicator of disease. We propose a convolutional network regression method to quantify the extent of EPVS in the basal ganglia from 3D brain MRI. We first segment the basal ganglia and subsequently apply a 3D convolutional regression network designed for small object detection within this region of interest. The network takes an image as input, and outputs a quantification score of EPVS. The network has significantly more convolution operations than pooling ones and no final activation, allowing it to span the space of real numbers. We validated our approach using a dataset of 2000 brain MRI scans scored visually. Experiments with varying sizes of training and test sets showed that a good performance can be achieved with a training set of only 200 scans. With a training set of 1000 scans, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between our scoring method and the expert's visual score was 0.74. Our method outperforms by a large margin - more than 0.10 - four more conventional automated approaches based on intensities, scale-invariant feature transform, and random forest. We show that the network learns the structures of interest and investigate the influence of hyper-parameters on the performance. We also evaluate the reproducibility of our network using a set of 60 subjects scanned twice (scan-rescan reproducibility).

METHODS: AF samples, which had been obtained in the second trimester from asymptomatic women with short CL (< 15 mm) identified on transvaginal ultrasound, were analyzed. CL, funneling and the presence of AF 'sludge' were assessed in all cases close to the time of amniocentesis. A combination of liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolomics, as well as targeted proteomics analysis, including chemokines, cytokines and growth factors, was performed on the AF samples. To determine the robustness of the markers, we used six different machine-learning techniques, including deep learning, to predict preterm delivery < 34 weeks, latency period prior to delivery < 28 days after amniocentesis and requirement for admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Omics biomarkers were evaluated alone and in combination with standard sonographic, clinical and demographic factors to predict outcome. Predictive accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) with 95% CI, sensitivity and specificity.
RESULTS: Of the 32 patients included in the study, complete omics, demographic and clinical data and outcome information were available for 26. Of these, 11 (42.3%) patients delivered ≥ 34 weeks, while 15 (57.7%) delivered < 34 weeks. There was no statistically significant difference in CL between these two groups (mean ± SD, 11.2 ± 4.4 mm vs 8.9 ± 5.3 mm, P = 0.31). Using combined omics, demographic and clinical data, deep learning displayed good to excellent performance, with an AUC (95% CI) of 0.890 (0.810-0.970) for delivery < 34 weeks' gestation, 0.890 (0.790-0.990) for delivery < 28 days post-amniocentesis and 0.792 (0.689-0.894) for NICU admission. These values were higher overall than for the other five machine-learning methods, although each individual machine-learning technique yielded statistically significant prediction of the different perinatal outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report use of AI with AF proteomics and metabolomics and ultrasound assessment in pregnancy. Machine learning, particularly deep learning, achieved good to excellent prediction of perinatal outcome in asymptomatic pregnant women with short CL in the second trimester. Copyright © 2018 ISUOG.

These studies extensively adopt univariate analysis by ignoring interaction effects. It is widely accepted that the etiology of most complex diseases depends on interactions between genetic variants and / or environmental factors. Several machine learning and data mining methods have been consistently successful in exposing these interaction effects. However, there has been no major breakthrough due to various biological complexities, and statistical computational challenges facing in the field of genetic epidemiology, despite of many efforts. Deep learning is emerging machine learning approach that promises to reveal the hidden patterns of big data for accurate predictions. In this study, a deep neural network is unified with a random forest by forming hybrid architecture, for achieving reliable detection of multi-locus interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms. The proposed hybrid method is evaluated on various simulated scenarios in the absence of main effect for six epistasis models. The best model with optimal hyper-parameters (grid and random grid search) is chosen to enhance the power of the method by maximising the model's prediction accuracy. The performance metrics of each model is analysed for both training and validation. Further, the performance of the method in the presence of noise due to missing data, genotyping errors, genetic heterogeneity, and phenocopy, and their combined effects are evaluated. The power of the method in detecting two-locus interactions is compared with the previous methods in the presence and absence of noise. On an average, the power of the proposed method is much higher than the previous methods for all simulated scenarios. Finally, findings are confirmed on a chronical dialysis patient's data, obtained from the published study performed at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.

The aim of this study was to apply deep machine learning methods to predict severe complications during critical care in real time after cardiothoracic surgery.
METHODS: We used deep learning methods (recurrent neural networks) to predict several severe complications (mortality, renal failure with a need for renal replacement therapy, and postoperative bleeding leading to operative revision) in post cardiosurgical care in real time. Adult patients who underwent major open heart surgery from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2016, in a German tertiary care centre for cardiovascular diseases formed the main derivation dataset. We measured the accuracy and timeliness of the deep learning model's forecasts and compared predictive quality to that of established standard-of-care clinical reference tools (clinical rule for postoperative bleeding, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II for mortality, and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes staging criteria for acute renal failure) using positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and the F<sub>1</sub> measure (which computes a harmonic mean of sensitivity and PPV). Results were externally retrospectively validated with 5898 cases from the published MIMIC-III dataset.
FINDINGS: Of 47 559 intensive care admissions (corresponding to 42 007 patients), we included 11 492 (corresponding to 9269 patients). The deep learning models yielded accurate predictions with the following PPV and sensitivity scores: PPV 0·90 and sensitivity 0·85 for mortality, 0·87 and 0·94 for renal failure, and 0·84 and 0·74 for bleeding. The predictions significantly outperformed the standard clinical reference tools, improving the absolute complication prediction AUC by 0·29 (95% CI 0·23-0·35) for bleeding, by 0·24 (0·19-0·29) for mortality, and by 0·24 (0·13-0·35) for renal failure (p<0·0001 for all three analyses). The deep learning methods showed accurate predictions immediately after patient admission to the intensive care unit. We also observed an increase in performance in our validation cohort when the machine learning approach was tested against clinical reference tools, with absolute improvements in AUC of 0·09 (95% CI 0·03-0·15; p=0·0026) for bleeding, of 0·18 (0·07-0·29; p=0·0013) for mortality, and of 0·25 (0·18-0·32; p<0·0001) for renal failure.
INTERPRETATION: The observed improvements in prediction for all three investigated clinical outcomes have the potential to improve critical care. These findings are noteworthy in that they use routinely collected clinical data exclusively, without the need for any manual processing. The deep machine learning method showed AUC scores that significantly surpass those of clinical reference tools, especially soon after admission. Taken together, these properties are encouraging for prospective deployment in critical care settings to direct the staff's attention towards patients who are most at risk.

The HITECH Act imposes penalties when patients are readmitted to hospitals if they are diagnosed with one of the six conditions mentioned in the Act. However, patients diagnosed with lupus are the sixth highest in terms of rehospitalization. The heterogeneity in the disease and patient characteristics makes it very hard to predict rehospitalization. This research utilizes deep learning methods to predict rehospitalization within 30 days by extracting the temporal relationships in the longitudinal EHR clinical data. Prediction results from deep learning methods such as LSTM are evaluated and compared with traditional classification methods such as penalized logistic regression and artificial neural networks. The simple recurrent neural network method and its variant, gated recurrent unit network, are also developed and validated to compare their performance against the proposed LSTM model. The results indicated that the deep learning method RNN-LSTM has a significantly better performance (with an AUC of .70) compared to traditional classification methods such as ANN (with an AUC of 0.66) and penalized logistic regression (with an AUC of 0.63). The rationale for the better performance of the deep learning method may be due to its ability to leverage the temporal relationships of the disease state in patients over time and to capture the progression of the disease-relevant clinical information from patients' prior visits is carried forward in the memory, which may have enabled the higher predictability for the deep learning methods.",0.25087422338245946,other,"logistic regression, LSTM, RNN"

In this work, our goal was to establish deep learning models which distinguish responders from non-responders, and also to predict possible antidepressant treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD). To uncover relationships between the responsiveness of antidepressant treatment and biomarkers, we developed a deep learning prediction approach resulting from the analysis of genetic and clinical factors such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), age, sex, baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score, depressive episodes, marital status, and suicide attempt status of MDD patients. The cohort consisted of 455 patients who were treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (treatment-response rate = 61.0%; remission rate = 33.0%). By using the SNP dataset that was original to a genome-wide association study, we selected 10 SNPs (including ABCA13 rs4917029, BNIP3 rs9419139, CACNA1E rs704329, EXOC4 rs6978272, GRIN2B rs7954376, LHFPL3 rs4352778, NELL1 rs2139423, NUAK1 rs2956406, PREX1 rs4810894, and SLIT3 rs139863958) which were associated with antidepressant treatment response. Furthermore, we pinpointed 10 SNPs (including ARNTL rs11022778, CAMK1D rs2724812, GABRB3 rs12904459, GRM8 rs35864549, NAALADL2 rs9878985, NCALD rs483986, PLA2G4A rs12046378, PROK2 rs73103153, RBFOX1 rs17134927, and ZNF536 rs77554113) in relation to remission. Then, we employed multilayer feedforward neural networks (MFNNs) containing 1-3 hidden layers and compared MFNN models with logistic regression models. Our analysis results revealed that the MFNN model with 2 hidden layers (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.8228 ± 0.0571; sensitivity = 0.7546 ± 0.0619; specificity = 0.6922 ± 0.0765) performed maximally among predictive models to infer the complex relationship between antidepressant treatment response and biomarkers. In addition, the MFNN model with 3 hidden layers (AUC = 0.8060 ± 0.0722; sensitivity = 0.7732 ± 0.0583; specificity = 0.6623 ± 0.0853) achieved best among predictive models to predict remission. Our study indicates that the deep MFNN framework may provide a suitable method to establish a tool for distinguishing treatment responders from non-responders prior to antidepressant therapy.",0.1000274763120142,other,logistic regression

Although traditional track-and-trigger systems are used to predict cardiac arrest early, they have limitations, with low sensitivity and high false-alarm rates. We propose a deep learning-based early warning system that shows higher performance than the existing track-and-trigger systems.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed patients who were admitted to 2 hospitals from June 2010 to July 2017. A total of 52 131 patients were included. Specifically, a recurrent neural network was trained using data from June 2010 to January 2017. The result was tested using the data from February to July 2017. The primary outcome was cardiac arrest, and the secondary outcome was death without attempted resuscitation. As comparative measures, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and the net reclassification index. Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity while varying the number of alarms. The deep learning-based early warning system (AUROC: 0.850; AUPRC: 0.044) significantly outperformed a modified early warning score (AUROC: 0.603; AUPRC: 0.003), a random forest algorithm (AUROC: 0.780; AUPRC: 0.014), and logistic regression (AUROC: 0.613; AUPRC: 0.007). Furthermore, the deep learning-based early warning system reduced the number of alarms by 82.2%, 13.5%, and 42.1% compared with the modified early warning system, random forest, and logistic regression, respectively, at the same sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm based on deep learning had high sensitivity and a low false-alarm rate for detection of patients with cardiac arrest in the multicenter study.",0.14708440461844022,other,"random forest, logistic regression"

Nevertheless, inadvertent use can negatively affect student learning. The present study aims to evaluate smartphone use in the educational context as well as Internet addiction and its repercussions on surface and deep learning and to compare them during the different phases of medical students' education. This is a cross-sectional study involving medical students in all phases of education. Sociodemographic data, type and frequency of smartphone use, degree of digital addiction (Internet Addiction Test - IAT), and surface and deep approaches to learning (Biggs) were analyzed. A total of 710 students were included. Almost all students had a smartphone and a total of 96.8% used it during lectures, classes, and meetings. Less than half of the students (47.3%) reported using a smartphone for more than 10 min for educational purposes, a usage that is higher among clerkship students. At least 95% reported using a smartphone in the classroom for activities not related to medicine (social media and searching for general information) and 68.2% were considered problematic Internet users according to the IAT. The most common reasons for noneducational use were that the class was uninteresting, students needed to receive or make an important call, and the educational strategy was not stimulating. The ""frequency of smartphone use"" and higher ""internet addiction"" were correlated to both higher levels of surface learning and lower levels of deep learning. Educators should advise and educate their students about conscientious use of this tool to avoid detrimental impact on the learning process.",0.14104875274909234,other,Unknown

METHODS: The data used to train and validate the algorithm consists of 59,985 patients with 87 features extracted at the end of surgery. Feed-forward networks with a logistic output were trained using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. The deep neural networks were trained on 80% of the data, with 20% reserved for testing. The authors assessed improvement of the deep neural network by adding American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification and robustness of the deep neural network to a reduced feature set. The networks were then compared to ASA Physical Status, logistic regression, and other published clinical scores including the Surgical Apgar, Preoperative Score to Predict Postoperative Mortality, Risk Quantification Index, and the Risk Stratification Index.
RESULTS: In-hospital mortality in the training and test sets were 0.81% and 0.73%. The deep neural network with a reduced feature set and ASA Physical Status classification had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.93). The highest logistic regression area under the curve was found with a reduced feature set and ASA Physical Status (0.90, 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.93). The Risk Stratification Index had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, at 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94 to 0.99).

Early detection and diagnosis of lung cancers is best achieved with low-dose computed tomography (CT). Classical radiomics features extracted from lung CT images have been shown as able to predict cancer incidence and prognosis. With the advancement of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep features can be identified to analyze lung CTs for prognosis prediction and diagnosis. Due to a limited number of available images in the medical field, the transfer learning concept can be helpful. Using subsets of participants from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), we utilized a transfer learning approach to differentiate lung cancer nodules versus positive controls. We experimented with three different pretrained CNNs for extracting deep features and used five different classifiers. Experiments were also conducted with deep features from different color channels of a pretrained CNN. Selected deep features were combined with radiomics features. A CNN was designed and trained. Combinations of features from pretrained, CNNs trained on NLST data, and classical radiomics were used to build classifiers. The best accuracy (76.79%) was obtained using feature combinations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, patients with previously diagnosed TB were enrolled. Photographs of their CXRs were taken using a consumer-grade digital still camera. The images were stratified by pathological patterns into classes: cavity, consolidation, effusion, interstitial changes, miliary pattern or normal examination. Image analysis was performed with commercially available Deep Learning software in two steps. Pathological areas were first localised; detected areas were then classified. Detection was assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, and classification using a confusion matrix.
RESULTS: The study cohort was 138 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and TB co-infection (median age 34 years, IQR 28-40); 54 patients were female. Localisation of pathological areas was excellent (area under the ROC curve 0.82). The software could perfectly distinguish pleural effusions from intraparenchymal changes. The most frequent misclassifications were consolidations as cavitations, and miliary patterns as interstitial patterns (and vice versa).
CONCLUSION: Deep Learning analysis of CXR photographs is a promising tool. Further efforts are needed to build larger, high-quality data sets to achieve better diagnostic performance.",0.13900998014447044,computer vision,Unknown

These big datasets offer great potential, but also challenge traditional epidemiological methods. This has motivated the exploration of alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. To this end, data mining and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to air pollution epidemiology.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on the application of data mining and machine learning methods in air pollution epidemiology. We carried out our search process in PubMed, the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Research articles applying data mining and machine learning methods to air pollution epidemiology were queried and reviewed.
RESULTS: Our search queries resulted in 400 research articles. Our fine-grained analysis employed our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the results to 47 articles, which we separate into three primary areas of interest: 1) source apportionment; 2) forecasting/prediction of air pollution/quality or exposure; and 3) generating hypotheses. Early applications had a preference for artificial neural networks. In more recent work, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering and the APRIORI algorithm have been widely applied. Our survey shows that the majority of the research has been conducted in Europe, China and the USA, and that data mining is becoming an increasingly common tool in environmental health. For potential new directions, we have identified that deep learning and geo-spacial pattern mining are two burgeoning areas of data mining that have good potential for future applications in air pollution epidemiology.
CONCLUSIONS: We carried out a systematic review identifying the current trends, challenges and new directions to explore in the application of data mining methods to air pollution epidemiology. This work shows that data mining is increasingly being applied in air pollution epidemiology. The potential to support air pollution epidemiology continues to grow with advancements in data mining related to temporal and geo-spacial mining, and deep learning. This is further supported by new sensors and storage mediums that enable larger, better quality data.

Here we use a cohort of 271 breast cancer tissues, 204 positive estrogen receptor (ER+), and 67 negative estrogen receptor (ER-) to test the accuracies of feed-forward networks, a deep learning (DL) framework, as well as six widely used machine learning models, namely random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), recursive partitioning and regression trees (RPART), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM), and generalized boosted models (GBM). DL framework has the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 in classifying ER+/ER- patients, compared to the other six machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the biological interpretation of the first hidden layer reveals eight commonly enriched significant metabolomics pathways (adjusted P-value <0.05) that cannot be discovered by other machine learning methods. Among them, protein digestion and absorption and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters pathways are also confirmed in integrated analysis between metabolomics and gene expression data in these samples. In summary, deep learning method shows advantages for metabolomics based breast cancer ER status classification, with both the highest prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.93) and better revelation of disease biology.

PARTICIPANTS: Diabetic retinal photos from Otago database photographed during October 2016 (485 photos), and 1200 photos from Messidor international database.
METHODS: Receiver operating characteristic curve to illustrate the ability of a deep neural network to identify referable diabetic retinopathy (moderate or worse diabetic retinopathy or exudates within one disc diameter of the fovea).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity and specificity.
RESULTS: For detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, the deep neural network had an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.901 (95% confidence interval 0.807-0.995), with 84.6% sensitivity and 79.7% specificity for Otago and 0.980 (95% confidence interval 0.973-0.986), with 96.0% sensitivity and 90.0% specificity for Messidor.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study has shown that a deep neural network can detect referable diabetic retinopathy with sensitivities and specificities close to or better than 80% from both an international and a domestic (New Zealand) database. We believe that deep neural networks can be integrated into community screening once they can successfully detect both diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema.",0.1874199053778739,other,Unknown

In this study, we propose a deep neural network model, DeepNovo, for de novo peptide sequencing. DeepNovo architecture combines recent advances in convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks to learn features of tandem mass spectra, fragment ions, and sequence patterns of peptides. The networks are further integrated with local dynamic programming to solve the complex optimization task of de novo sequencing. We evaluated the method on a wide variety of species and found that DeepNovo considerably outperformed state of the art methods, achieving 7.7-22.9% higher accuracy at the amino acid level and 38.1-64.0% higher accuracy at the peptide level. We further used DeepNovo to automatically reconstruct the complete sequences of antibody light and heavy chains of mouse, achieving 97.5-100% coverage and 97.2-99.5% accuracy, without assisting databases. Moreover, DeepNovo is retrainable to adapt to any sources of data and provides a complete end-to-end training and prediction solution to the de novo sequencing problem. Not only does our study extend the deep learning revolution to a new field, but it also shows an innovative approach in solving optimization problems by using deep learning and dynamic programming.",0.10018365883978302,computer vision,Unknown

Yet, such approaches have hardly been applied to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, probably due to the high number of features typically exceeding the number of studied individuals.
RESULTS: After a brief overview of how deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs), a deep learning approach, can be adapted to SNP data in principle, we specifically present a way to alleviate the dimensionality problem by partitioned learning. We propose a sparse regression approach to coarsely screen the joint distribution of SNPs, followed by training several DBMs on SNP partitions that were identified by the screening. Aggregate features representing SNP patterns and the corresponding SNPs are extracted from the DBMs by a combination of statistical tests and sparse regression. In simulated case-control data, we show how this can uncover complex SNP patterns and augment results from univariate approaches, while maintaining type 1 error control. Time-to-event endpoints are considered in an application with acute myeloid leukemia patients, where SNP patterns are modeled after a pre-screening based on gene expression data. The proposed approach identified three SNPs that seem to jointly influence survival in a validation dataset. This indicates the added value of jointly investigating SNPs compared to standard univariate analyses and makes partitioned learning of DBMs an interesting complementary approach when analyzing SNP data.

Currently, it remains rather difficult to predict survival based on clinical parameters alone. Here, we set out to use clinical characteristics in combination with MRI data to predict survival of ALS patients using deep learning, a machine learning technique highly effective in a broad range of big-data analyses. A group of 135 ALS patients was included from whom high-resolution diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted images were acquired at the first visit to the outpatient clinic. Next, each of the patients was monitored carefully and survival time to death was recorded. Patients were labeled as short, medium or long survivors, based on their recorded time to death as measured from the time of disease onset. In the deep learning procedure, the total group of 135 patients was split into a training set for deep learning (n = 83 patients), a validation set (n = 20) and an independent evaluation set (n = 32) to evaluate the performance of the obtained deep learning networks. Deep learning based on clinical characteristics predicted survival category correctly in 68.8% of the cases. Deep learning based on MRI predicted 62.5% correctly using structural connectivity and 62.5% using brain morphology data. Notably, when we combined the three sources of information, deep learning prediction accuracy increased to 84.4%. Taken together, our findings show the added value of MRI with respect to predicting survival in ALS, demonstrating the advantage of deep learning in disease prognostication.",0.3863782253579152,computer vision,Unknown

It is crucial to characterize the disease and the evolution of the ongoing epidemic efficiently and accurately. Computational epidemiology can model the disease progress and underlying contact network, but suffers from the lack of real-time and fine-grained surveillance data. Social media, on the other hand, provides timely and detailed disease surveillance, but is insensible to the underlying contact network and disease model. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised deep learning framework that integrates the strengths of computational epidemiology and social media mining techniques. Specifically, this framework learns the social media users' health states and intervention actions in real time, which are regularized by the underlying disease model and contact network. Conversely, the learned knowledge from social media can be fed into computational epidemic model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease diffusion modeling. We propose an online optimization algorithm to substantialize the above interactive learning process iteratively to achieve a consistent stage of the integration. The extensive experimental results demonstrated that our approach can effectively characterize the spatio-temporal disease diffusion, outperforming competing methods by a substantial margin on multiple metrics.",0.12348300387548554,other,Unknown

Epub 2016 May 30.,Welchowski T,Artif Intell Med,2016,2016/07/20,,,10.1016/j.artmed.2016.04.002,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Kernel deep stacking networks (KDSNs) are a novel method for supervised learning in biomedical research. Belonging to the class of deep learning techniques, KDSNs are based on artificial neural network architectures that involve multiple nonlinear transformations of the input data. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks, KDSNs do not rely on backpropagation algorithms but on an efficient fitting procedure that is based on a series of kernel ridge regression models with closed-form solutions. Although being computationally advantageous, KDSN modeling remains a challenging task, as it requires the specification of a large number of tuning parameters.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: We propose a new data-driven framework for parameter estimation, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection in KDSNs. The proposed methodology is based on a combination of model-based optimization and hill climbing approaches that do not require the pre-specification of any of the KDSN tuning parameters. We demonstrate the performance of KDSNs by analyzing three medical data sets on hospital readmission of diabetes patients, coronary artery disease, and hospital costs.
RESULTS: Our numerical studies show that the run-time of the proposed KDSN methodology is significantly shorter than the respective run-time of grid search strategies for hyperparameter tuning. They also show that KDSN modeling is competitive in terms of prediction accuracy with other state-of-the-art techniques for statistical learning.
CONCLUSIONS: KDSNs are a computationally efficient approximation of backpropagation-based artificial neural network techniques. Application of the proposed methodology results in a fast tuning procedure that generates KDSN fits having a similar prediction accuracy as other techniques in the field of deep learning.",0.10491028601879376,other,Unknown

However, with increasing multiculturalism in higher education, there is little information available as to the acceptance of this form of learning by Asian students or as to its value to them.
METHODOLOGY: Group-learning projects, incorporating a seminar presentation, were used in first-year veterinary anatomical science classes over two consecutive years (2003 and 2004) at the School of Veterinary Science, University of Queensland. Responses of Australian and Asian students to survey forms evaluating the learning experience were analyzed and compared.
RESULTS: All students responded positively to the group learning, indicating that it was a useful learning experience and a great method for meeting colleagues. There were no significant differences between Asian and Australian students in overall responses to the survey evaluating the learning experience, except where Asian students responded significantly higher than Australian students in identifying specific skills that needed improving.

Based on the epidemiological investigations of 1218 COVID-19 cases in eight areas of China, we use text analysis, social network analysis and visualization methods to construct a dynamic contact network of the epidemic. We analyze the corresponding demographic characteristics, network indicators, and structural characteristics of this network. We found that more than 65% of cases are likely to be infected by a strong relationship, and nearly 40% of cases have family members infected at the same time. The overall connectivity of the contact network is low, but there are still some clustered infections. In terms of the degree distribution, most cases' degrees are concentrated between 0 and 2, which is relatively low, and only a few ones have a higher degree value. The degree distribution also conforms to the power law distribution, indicating the network is a scale-free network. There are 17 cases with a degree greater than 10, and these cluster infections are usually caused by local transmission. The first implication of this research is we find that the COVID-19 spread is closely related to social structures by applying computational sociological methods for infectious disease studies; the second implication is to confirm that text analysis can quickly visualize the spread trajectory at the beginning of an epidemic.",0.2060838342387975,other,Unknown

Machine learning approaches have been shown to be effective for clinical text classification tasks. However, a successful machine learning model usually requires extensive human efforts to create labeled training data and conduct feature engineering. In this study, we propose a clinical text classification paradigm using weak supervision and deep representation to reduce these human efforts.
METHODS: We develop a rule-based NLP algorithm to automatically generate labels for the training data, and then use the pre-trained word embeddings as deep representation features for training machine learning models. Since machine learning is trained on labels generated by the automatic NLP algorithm, this training process is called weak supervision. We evaluat the paradigm effectiveness on two institutional case studies at Mayo Clinic: smoking status classification and proximal femur (hip) fracture classification, and one case study using a public dataset: the i2b2 2006 smoking status classification shared task. We test four widely used machine learning models, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), using this paradigm. Precision, recall, and F1 score are used as metrics to evaluate performance.
RESULTS: CNN achieves the best performance in both institutional tasks (F1 score: 0.92 for Mayo Clinic smoking status classification and 0.97 for fracture classification). We show that word embeddings significantly outperform tf-idf and topic modeling features in the paradigm, and that CNN captures additional patterns from the weak supervision compared to the rule-based NLP algorithms. We also observe two drawbacks of the proposed paradigm that CNN is more sensitive to the size of training data, and that the proposed paradigm might not be effective for complex multiclass classification tasks.
CONCLUSION: The proposed clinical text classification paradigm could reduce human efforts of labeled training data creation and feature engineering for applying machine learning to clinical text classification by leveraging weak supervision and deep representation. The experimental experiments have validated the effectiveness of paradigm by two institutional and one shared clinical text classification tasks.",0.11950809377737157,both,"Support Vector Machine, SVM, topic modeling, tf-idf, CNN, Random Forest"

Epub 2005 Sep 13.,Wren JD,Bioinformatics,2005,2005/09/15,,,10.1093/bioinformatics/bti657,"MOTIVATION: Short sequence patterns frequently define regions of biological interest (binding sites, immune epitopes, primers, etc.), yet a large fraction of this information exists only within the scientific literature and is thus difficult to locate via conventional means (e.g. keyword queries or manual searches). We describe herein a system to accurately identify and classify sequence patterns from within large corpora using an n-gram Markov model (MM).
RESULTS: As expected, on test sets we found that identification of sequences with limited alphabets and/or regular structures such as nucleic acids (non-ambiguous) and peptide abbreviations (3-letter) was highly accurate, whereas classification of symbolic (1-letter) peptide strings with more complex alphabets was more problematic. The MM was used to analyze two very large, sequence-containing corpora: over 7.75 million Medline abstracts and 9000 full-text articles from Journal of Virology. Performance was benchmarked by comparing the results with Journal of Virology entries in two existing manually curated databases: VirOligo and the HLA Ligand Database. Performance estimates were 98 +/- 2% precision/84% recall for primer identification and classification and 67 +/- 6% precision/85% recall for peptide epitopes. We also find a dramatic difference between the amounts of sequence-related data reported in abstracts versus full text. Our results suggest that automated extraction and classification of sequence elements is a promising, low-cost means of sequence database curation and annotation.

In the context of a deliberately released pathogen, such as Bacillus anthracis (the disease-causing organism of anthrax), this can allow responders to quickly identify the location and timing of the release, as well as other factors such as the strength of the release, and the realized wind speed and direction at release. These estimates can then be used to parameterise a predictive mechanistic model, allowing for estimation of the potential scale of the release, and to optimise the distribution of prophylaxis.

OBJECTIVE: To establish predictive models for ROP occurrence based on the risk factors using artificial neural network.
METHODS: A cohort of 591 infants was recruited in this retrospective study. The association between ROP and perinatal factors was analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression. We developed predictive models for ROP screening using back propagation neural network, which was further optimized by applying genetic algorithm method. To assess the predictive performance of the models, the areas under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and accuracy were used to show the performances of the prediction models.
RESULTS: ROP of any stage was found in 193 (32.7%) infants. Twelve risk factors of ROP were selected. Based on these factors, predictive models were built using BP neural network and genetic algorithm-back propagation (GA-BP) neural network.

In this study, we applied machine learning algorithms to explore the relationships between PANoptosis-related lncRNAs (PRLs) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and established a neural network model for prognostic prediction.
METHODS: Information about the HNSCC cohort was downloaded from the TCGA database, and the differentially expressed prognostic PRLs between tumor and normal samples were assessed in patients with different tumor subtypes via nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) analysis. Subsequently, five kinds of machine-learning algorithms were used to select the core PRLs across the subtypes, and the interactive features were pooled into a neural network model to establish a PRL-related risk score (PLRS) system. Survival differences were compared via Kaplan‒Meier analysis, and the predictive effects were assessed with the areas under the ROCs. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis, immune infiltration, tumor mutation burden (TMB) and clinical therapeutic response were also conducted to further evaluate the novel predictive model.
RESULTS: A total of 347 PRLs were identified, 225 of which were differentially expressed between tumor and normal samples. Patients were divided into two clusters via NMF analysis, in which cluster 1 had a better prognosis and more immune cells and functional infiltrates. With the application of five machine learning algorithms, we selected 13 interactive PRLs to construct the predictive model.

This study aimed to develop an effective hypertension classification model and investigate the potential influence of genetic liability for multiple risk factors linked to CVD on hypertension risk using the random forest and the neural network. Materials and Methods: The study involved 244,718 European participants, who were divided into training and testing sets. Genetic liabilities were constructed using genetic variants associated with CVD risk factors obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Various combinations of machine learning models before and after feature selection were tested to develop the best classification model. The models were evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), calibration, and net reclassification improvement in the testing set. Results: The models without genetic liabilities achieved AUCs of 0.70 and 0.72 using the random forest and the neural network methods, respectively. Adding genetic liabilities improved the AUC for the random forest but not for the neural network.

The CatBoost machine learning model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 72.22%, while the stacking ensemble model yielded an AUC of 60.59% for mortality prediction. The proposed subdivision technique, on the other hand, provides a significant improvement in performance metrics, with an AUC of 85.2% and an accuracy of 89.32%. These findings emphasize the potential of machine learning in enhancing pediatric mortality prediction and inform strategies for improved ICU readiness.",0.10675974682596609,other,Random Forest

Neural network-based methods can be prime candidates for retrieving insights from these sequences because of their applicability to large and diverse datasets. However, the highly variable lengths of genome sequences severely impair the presentation of sequences as input to the neural network. Genetic variations further complicate tasks that involve sequence comparison or alignment.
RESULTS: Inspired by the theory and applications of ""spaced seeds,"" we propose a graph representation of genome sequences called ""gapped pattern graph."" These graphs can be transformed through a Graph Convolutional Network to form lower-dimensional embeddings for downstream tasks. On the basis of the gapped pattern graphs, we implemented a neural network model and demonstrated its performance on diverse tasks involving microbe and mammalian genome data. Our method consistently outperformed all the other state-of-the-art methods across various metrics on all tasks, especially for the sequences with limited homology to the training data. In addition, our model was able to identify distinct gapped pattern signatures from the sequences.

The primary aim of this study was to generate the first machine-learning algorithm to predict the risk of mortality following the diagnosis of an appendiceal neoplasm.
METHODS: Patients with primary appendiceal cancer in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 2000 to 2019 were included. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and survival data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Extreme gradient boost, random forest, neural network, and logistic regression machine learning models were employed to predict 1-, 5-, and 10-year mortality. After algorithm validation, the best-performance model was used to develop a patient-specific web-based risk prediction model.
RESULTS: A total of 16,579 patients were included in the study, with 13,262 in the training group (80%) and 3,317 in the validation group (20%). Extreme gradient boost exhibited the highest prediction accuracy for 1-, 5-, and 10-year mortality, with the 10-year model exhibiting the maximum area under the curve (0.909 [±0.006]) after 10-fold cross-validation. Variables that significantly influenced the predictive ability of the model were disease grade, malignant carcinoid histology, incidence of positive regional lymph nodes, number of nodes harvested, and presence of distant disease.
CONCLUSION: Here, we report the development and validation of a novel prognostic prediction model for patients with appendiceal neoplasms of numerous histologic subtypes that incorporate a vast array of patient, surgical, and pathologic variables.

In this sense, wastewater-based epidemiology remains a powerful tool for supporting regional health administrations in assessing risk levels and acting accordingly. In this work, a dynamic artificial neural network (DANN) has been developed for predicting the number of COVID-19 hospitalized patients in hospitals in Valladolid (Spain). This model takes as inputs a wastewater epidemiology indicator for COVID-19 (concentration of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene reported from Valladolid Wastewater Treatment Plant), vaccination coverage, and past data of hospitalizations. The model considered both the instantaneous values of these variables and their historical evolution. Two study periods were selected (from May 2021 until September 2022 and from September 2022 to July 2023). During the first period, accurate predictions of hospitalizations (with an overall range between 6 and 171) were favored by the correlation of this indicator with N1 concentrations in wastewater (r = 0.43, p < 0.05), showing accurate forecasting for 1 day ahead and 5 days ahead. The second period's retraining strategy maintained the overall accuracy of the model despite lower hospitalizations. Furthermore, risk levels were assigned to each 1 day ahead prediction during the first and second periods, showing agreement with the level measured and reported by regional health authorities in 95 % and 93 % of cases, respectively. These results evidenced the potential of this novel DANN model for predicting COVID-19 hospitalizations based on SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations at a regional scale.

A disturbed balance between frontostriatal and stress brain circuitry influences the development of SUD, its continuation, and vulnerability for relapse.
AIM: To provide a concise overview of neural networks in SUD, and discuss implications for clinical practice.
METHOD: Narrative literature review on neurobiological mechanisms of neural networks in substance use disorders.
RESULTS: Changes in frontostriatal circuitry play an important role for sensitivity to substance-related rewards, and can lead to loss of control over substance use. On the other hand, the use of substances affects the brain&rsquo;s stress system, which affects frontostriatal network functioning. Substance use can activate stress circuitry in the brain, which can lead to an increase in use or relapse. The level at which neural network functioning is affected can differ highly between persons with SUD, and is dependent on the SUD stage and the presence of other psychiatric comorbidity.
CONCLUSION: Improved understanding of neural networks involved in SUD can lead to the development of new and more personalized treatment- and prevention strategies.

Due to the rapid spread of the disease, the number of deceased individuals increased as well, which is a motivation to prevent as many new infections as possible. Therefore, the knowledge about the current evolution of the virus spread is crucial to predict its future behavior and to react with suitable interventions. In this paper, the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany is forecasted by a network-based inference method, in which the interactions of individuals are taken into account using a contact matrix. Then the results are compared to the predictions without considering a contact matrix as well as to the logistic regression, which shows the advantage of incorporating the contact matrix. Furthermore, the basic reproduction number of the pandemic in Germany using a neural network approach is estimated and used for further predictions of the evolution of COVID-19 in Germany. In order to mathematically model the different compartments of the population in the considered regions, the classical SIR model is employed. In this work, we deploy the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) for the unknown parameter estimation. Furthermore, we calculate and illustrate the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) of the estimations to show the accuracy of the predictions. The results include model parameter estimation and model validation, as well as the outbreak forecasting using network-informed algorithms. Our findings show that the network-inference based approach outperforms the logistic regression as well as the neural network approach and the SIR model calibration without a contact network. Furthermore according to the results, the network-inference based approach is particularly suitable for short- to mid-term predictions, even when there is not much information about the new disease. Moreover, the predictions based on the estimation of the reproduction number in Germany can yield more reliable results with increasing the availability of data, but could not outperform the network-inference based algorithm.",0.19597909058720409,other,logistic regression

Due to various unpredictable factors, including population migration, vaccination, control efforts, and seasonal fluctuations, traditional epidemic models that rely on prior knowledge of virus transmission mechanisms may not be sufficient to forecast complex epidemics like coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19). The application of traditional epidemiological models such as susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) may face difficulties in accurately predicting such complex epidemics. Data-driven prediction approaches lack the ability to generalize and exhibit low accuracy on small datasets due to their reliance on large amounts of data without incorporating prior knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a flexible ensemble data-driven framework (Neural-SEIR) that ""neuralizes"" the SEIR model by approximating the core parameters through neural networks while preserving the propagation structure of SEIR. Neural-SEIR employs long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to capture complex correlation features, exponential smoothing (ES) to model seasonal information, and prior knowledge from SEIR. By incorporating SEIR parameters into the neural network structure, Neural-SEIR leverages prior knowledge while updating parameters with real-world data.

AIMS: This study aimed to segment older adult sports participants based on their demographic characteristics and exercise practice behavior and applied artificial neural network and logistic regression models to these segments to best predict the effect of medical cost reduction. It presents strategies for older adult sports participation.
METHODS: A sample comprising data on 1,770 older adults aged 50 years and above was drawn from the 2019 National Sports Survey.

However, FTIR spectroscopy has been shown to have a high detection limit for fentanyl and interpretation of results by a technician can be subjective. This poses concern, given that some synthetic opioids can produce serious toxicity at sub-detectable levels. The objective of this study was to develop a neural network model to identify fentanyl and related analogues more accurately in drug samples compared to traditional analysis by technicians.
METHODS: Data were drawn from samples analyzed point-of-care using combination FTIR spectroscopy and fentanyl immunoassay strips in British Columbia between August 2018 and January 2021. We developed neural network models to predict the presence of fentanyl based on FTIR data. The final model was validated against the results from immunoassay strips. Prediction performance was assessed using F1 score, accuracy, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and was compared to results obtained from analysis by technicians.
RESULTS: A total of 12,684 samples were included. The neural network model outperformed results from those analyzed by technicians, with an F1 score of 96.4% and an accuracy of 96.4%, compared to 78.4% and 82.4% with a technician, respectively. The AUROC of the model was 99.0%. Fentanyl positive samples correctly detected by the model but not by the technician were typically those with low fentanyl concentrations (median: 2.3% quantity by weight; quartile 1-3: 0.0%-4.6%).

For years, there have been attempts to create an ideal tool to predict the outcomes and severity of injuries. The aim of this study was evaluation of the use of selected artificial intelligence methods for outcome predictions of head and neck injuries.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 6,824 consecutive cases of patients who sustained head and neck injuries, treated in hospitals in the Lublin Province between 2006-2018, whose data was provided by National Institute of Public Health / National Institute of Hygiene, were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were qualified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (10th Revision). The multilayer perceptron (MLP) structure was utilized in numerical studies. Neural network training was achieved with the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method.
RESULTS: In the designed network, the highest classification efficiency was obtained for the group of deaths (80.7%). The average value of correct classifications for all analyzed cases was 66%.

Results. Data for 113 patients with SSIs was available. Of these 62 (54.8%) had superficial and 51 had (45.2%) deep/organ space infections. Compared with other ML algorithms, the XG boost univariate model had highest AUC-ROC (.84) for prediction of type of SSI and Stochastic gradient boosting univariate, logistic regression univariate, XG boost univariate, and random forest classification univariate model had the highest AUC-ROC (.74) for prediction of week of infection. Conclusions. ML models offer reasonable accuracy in prediction of superficial vs deep SSI and time of developing infection. Follow-up duration and allocation of treatment strategies can be informed by ML predictions.",0.10329959419195592,other,"random forest, logistic regression"

Clinicians need assistance in supporting their decisions regarding the management of these patients. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help with this regard. However, the lack of explainability-defined as ""the ability to understand and evaluate the internal mechanism of the algorithm/computational process in human terms""-of AI is one of the major challenges to its application in health care. We know little about application of explainable AI (XAI) in health care. Objective: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the development of explainable machine learning models to predict COVID-19 severity among older adults. Design: Quantitative machine learning methods. Setting: Long-term care facilities within the province of Quebec. Participants: Patients 65 years and older presented to the hospitals who had a positive polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19. Intervention: We used XAI-specific methods (e.g., EBM), machine learning methods (i.e., random forest, deep forest, and XGBoost), as well as explainable approaches such as LIME, SHAP, PIMP, and anchor with the mentioned machine learning methods. Outcome measures: Classification accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The age distribution of the patients (n=986, 54.6% male) was 84.5□19.5 years. The best-performing models (and their performance) were as follows. Deep forest using XAI agnostic methods LIME (97.36% AUC, 91.65 ACC), Anchor (97.36% AUC, 91.65 ACC), and PIMP (96.93% AUC, 91.65 ACC). We found alignment with the identified reasoning of our models' predictions and clinical studies' findings-about the correlation of different variables such as diabetes and dementia, and the severity of COVID-19 in this population. Conclusions: The use of explainable machine learning models, to predict the severity of COVID-19 among older adults is feasible. We obtained a high-performance level as well as explainability in the prediction of COVID-19 severity in this population. Further studies are required to integrate these models into a decision support system to facilitate the management of diseases such as COVID-19 for (primary) health care providers and evaluate their usability among them.",0.11145541911193062,other,random forest

It is of great importance to use machine learning to build a prediction model of tuberculosis incidence influenced by meteorological and air pollutants for timely and applicable measures of both prevention and control.
METHODS: The data of daily TB notifications, meteorological factors and air pollutants in Changde City, Hunan Province ranging from 2010 to 2021 were collected. Spearman rank correlation analysis was conducted to analyze the correlation between the daily TB notifications and the meteorological factors or air pollutants. Based on the correlation analysis results, machine learning methods, including support vector regression, random forest regression and a BP neural network model, were utilized to construct the incidence prediction model of tuberculosis. RMSE, MAE and MAPE were performed to evaluate the constructed model for selecting the best prediction model.
RESULTS: (1) From the year 2010 to 2021, the overall incidence of tuberculosis in Changde City showed a downward trend. (2) The daily TB notifications was positively correlated with average temperature (r = 0.231), maximum temperature (r = 0.194), minimum temperature (r = 0.165), sunshine duration (r = 0.329), PM<sub>2.5</sub> (r = 0.097), PM<sub>10</sub> (r = 0.215) and O<sub>3</sub> (r = 0.084) (p &lt; 0.05). However, there was a significant negative correlation between the daily TB notifications and mean air pressure (r = -0.119), precipitation (r = -0.063), relative humidity (r = -0.084), CO (r = -0.038) and SO<sub>2</sub> (r = -0.034) (p &lt; 0.05). (3) The random forest regression model had the best fitting effect, while the BP neural network model exhibited the best prediction. (4) The validation set of the BP neural network model, including average daily temperature, sunshine hours and PM<sub>10</sub>, showed the lowest root mean square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error, followed by support vector regression.
CONCLUSIONS: The prediction trend of the BP neural network model, including average daily temperature, sunshine hours and PM<sub>10</sub>, successfully mimics the actual incidence, and the peak incidence highly coincides with the actual aggregation time, with a high accuracy and a minimum error. Taken together, these data suggest that the BP neural network model can predict the incidence trend of tuberculosis in Changde City.",0.12359264963666025,other,random forest

Integrating data from multiple sensor networks for short-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> prediction remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a machine learning approach to predict ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration levels at any unmonitored location several hours ahead using PM<sub>2.5</sub> observations from nearby monitoring sites from two sensor networks and the location's social and environmental properties. Specifically, this approach first applies a Graph Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory (GNN-LSTM) network to time series of daily observations from a regulatory monitoring network to make predictions of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. This network produces feature vectors to store aggregated daily observations as well as dependency characteristics to predict daily PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The daily feature vectors are then set as the precondition of the hourly level learning process. The hourly level learning again uses a GNN-LSTM network based on daily dependency information and hourly observations from a low-cost sensor network to produce spatiotemporal feature vectors capturing the combined dependency described by daily and hourly observations. Finally, the spatiotemporal feature vectors from the hourly learning process and social-environmental data are merged and used as the input to a single-layer Fully Connected (FC) network to output the predicted hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations. To demonstrate the benefits of this novel prediction approach, we have conducted a case study using data collected from two sensor networks in Denver, CO, during 2021. Results show that the utilization of data from two sensor networks improves the overall performance of predicting fine-level, short-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations compared to other baseline models.",0.113305062792763,other,LSTM

Yet, many current parameter estimation methods are mathematically involved and computationally slow to run. In this paper, we present a computationally simple and fast method to retrieve accurate probability densities for model parameters using neural differential equations. We present a pipeline comprising multiagent models acting as forward solvers for systems of ordinary or stochastic differential equations and a neural network to then extract parameters from the data generated by the model. The two combined create a powerful tool that can quickly estimate densities on model parameters, even for very large systems. We demonstrate the method on synthetic time series data of the SIR model of the spread of infection and perform an in-depth analysis of the Harris-Wilson model of economic activity on a network, representing a nonconvex problem. For the latter, we apply our method both to synthetic data and to data of economic activity across Greater London.

Our model is capable of approximating highly complex predictive density functions and fully learn the possible random variation in the outcome variables. For posterior computation, we provide a closed-form Gibbs sampling algorithm that circumvents tuning-intensive Metropolis-Hastings methods.

In a population-based sample (N = 174) with a high representation of marginalized individuals, this study examined adolescent functional network connectivity as a marker of susceptibility to anxiety and depression in the context of adverse experiences.
METHODS: Data-driven network-based subgroups were identified using an unsupervised community detection algorithm within functional neural connectivity. Neuroimaging data collected during emotion processing (age 15) were extracted from a priori regions of interest linked to anxiety and depression. Symptoms were self-reported at ages 15, 17, and 21 (during COVID-19). During COVID-19, participants reported on pandemic-related economic adversity. Differences across subgroup networks were first examined, then subgroup membership and subgroup-adversity interaction were tested to predict change in symptoms over time.
RESULTS: Two subgroups were identified: Subgroup A, characterized by relatively greater neural network variation (i.e., heterogeneity) and density with more connections involving the amygdala, subgenual cingulate, and ventral striatum; and the more homogenous Subgroup B, with more connections involving the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate. Accounting for initial symptoms, subgroup A individuals had greater increases in symptoms across time (β = .138, p = .042), and this result remained after adjusting for additional covariates (β = .194, p = .023). Furthermore, there was a subgroup-adversity interaction: compared with Subgroup B, Subgroup A reported greater anxiety during the pandemic in response to reported economic adversity (β = .307, p = .006), and this remained after accounting for initial symptoms and many covariates (β = .237, p = .021).

Thus, the performance of the current machine learning-based breast cancer risk prediction models and their benefits and weakness need to be evaluated for the future development of feasible and efficient risk prediction models.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to assess the performance and the clinical feasibility of the currently available machine learning-based breast cancer risk prediction models.
METHODS: We searched for papers published until June 9, 2021, on machine learning-based breast cancer risk prediction models in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Studies describing the development or validation models for predicting future breast cancer risk were included. The Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) was used to assess the risk of bias and the clinical applicability of the included studies. The pooled area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 8 studies with 10 data sets were included. Neural network was the most common machine learning method for the development of breast cancer risk prediction models. The pooled AUC of the machine learning-based optimal risk prediction model reported in each study was 0.73 (95% CI 0.66-0.80; approximate 95% prediction interval 0.56-0.96), with a high level of heterogeneity between studies (Q=576.07, I2=98.44%; P&lt;.001). The results of head-to-head comparison of the performance difference between the 2 types of models trained by the same data set showed that machine learning models had a slightly higher advantage than traditional risk factor-based models in predicting future breast cancer risk. The pooled AUC of the neural network-based risk prediction model was higher than that of the nonneural network-based optimal risk prediction model (0.71 vs 0.68, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that the incorporation of imaging features in risk models resulted in a higher pooled AUC than the nonincorporation of imaging features in risk models (0.73 vs 0.61; P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=.001, respectively). The PROBAST analysis indicated that many machine learning models had high risk of bias and poorly reported calibration analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows that the current machine learning-based breast cancer risk prediction models have some technical pitfalls and that their clinical feasibility and reliability are unsatisfactory.",0.10739101686186243,other,Unknown

We consider the Susceptible-Infected-Confirmed-Recovered-Deceased (SICRD) compartmental model, with the goal of estimating the unknown infected compartment I, and several unknown parameters. We apply a variation of a ""Physics Informed Neural Network"" (PINN), which uses knowledge of the system to aid learning. First, we ensure estimation is possible by verifying the model's identifiability. Then, we propose a wavelet transform to process data for the network training. Finally, our central result is a novel modification of the PINN's loss function to reduce the number of simultaneously considered unknowns. We find that our modified network is capable of stable, efficient, and accurate estimation, while the unmodified network consistently yields incorrect values. The modified network is also shown to be efficient enough to be applied to a model with time-varying parameters. We present an application of our model results for ranking states by their estimated relative testing efficiency. Our findings suggest the effectiveness of our modified PINN network, especially in the case of multiple unknown variables.",0.18911965777764086,other,Unknown

As a result, it is critical to understand and collect primary data on the virus, infection epidemiology, and treatment. Despite the speed with which the virus was detected, studies of its cell biology and architecture at the ultrastructural level are still in their infancy. Therefore, we investigated and analyzed the viral morphometry of SARS-CoV-2 to extract important key points of the virus's characteristics. Then, we proposed a prediction model to identify the real virus levels based on the optimization of a full recurrent neural network (RNN) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Consequently, identification of virus levels depends on the size of the morphometry of the area (width, height, circularity, roundness, aspect ratio, and solidity). The results of our model were an error score of training network performance 3.216 × 10-11 at 639 epoch, regression of -1.6 × 10-9, momentum gain (Mu) 1 × 10-9, and gradient value of 9.6852 × 10-8, which represent a network with a high ability to predict virus levels.

Specifically, during pregnancy, different health factors like age, blood disorders, heart rate, etc. can lead to pregnancy complications. Detecting such health factors can alleviate the risk of pregnancy-related complications. This study aims to develop an artificial neural network-based system for predicting maternal health risks using health data records. A novel deep neural network architecture, DT-BiLTCN is proposed that uses decision trees, a bidirectional long short-term memory network, and a temporal convolutional network. Experiments involve using a dataset of 1218 samples collected from maternal health care, hospitals, and community clinics using the IoT-based risk monitoring system. Class imbalance is resolved using the synthetic minority oversampling technique. DT-BiLTCN provides a feature set to obtain high accuracy results which in this case are provided by the support vector machine with a 98% accuracy. Maternal health exploratory data analysis reveals that the health conditions which are the strongest indications of health risk during pregnancy are diastolic and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and age of pregnant women.

This neural network requires a sequence of time instances as direct input of the network and the numbers of susceptibles, vaccinated, infected, hospitalized, and recovered individuals per time instance to learn certain parameters of the underlying model, which are used for the loss calculations. The established model is an extended susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model in which the transitions between disease-related population groups, called compartments, and the physical laws of epidemic transmission dynamics are expressed by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The system of ODEs and its time derivative are included in the residual loss function of the PINN in addition to the data error between the current network output and the time series data of the compartment sizes. Further, we illustrate how this PINN approach can also be used for differential equation-based models such as the proposed extended SIR model, called SVIHR model. In a validation process, we compare the performance of the PINN with results obtained with the numerical technique of non-standard finite differences (NSFD) in generating future COVID-19 scenarios based on the parameters identified by the PINN. The used training data set covers the time between the outbreak of the pandemic in Germany and the last week of the year 2021.

The artificial neural network model, the naive Bayes model, and the logistic regression model were used for prediction. The findings showed that age, gender, ethnic, household registration, education level, occupation, duration of residence, scope of migration, housing, economic conditions, and health services all affected the reproductive behavior of the floating population. Among them, the improvement duration of post-migration residence and family economic conditions positively impacted their fertility behavior. Non-agricultural new industry workers with college degrees or above living in first-tier cities were less likely to have children and more likely to delay childbearing. Among the prediction models, both the artificial neural network model and logistic regression model had better prediction effects.

The paper aimed to find the accuracy of machine learning models in predicting under-five mortality and identify the most significant factors associated with under-five mortality.
METHOD: The data was taken from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-IV) of Uttar Pradesh. First, we used multivariate logistic regression due to its capability for predicting the important factors, then we used machine learning techniques such as decision tree, random forest, Naïve Bayes, K- nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), neural network, and ridge classifier. Each model's accuracy was checked by a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Cohen's Kappa, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC). Information gain rank was used to find the important factors for under-five mortality. Data analysis was performed using, STATA-16.0, Python 3.3, and IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0 software.
RESULT: By applying the machine learning models, results showed that the neural network model was the best predictive model for under-five mortality when compared with other predictive models, with model accuracy of (95.29% to 95.96%), recall (71.51% to 81.03%), precision (36.64% to 51.83%), F1 score (50.46% to 62.68%), Cohen's Kappa value (0.48 to 0.60), AUROC range (93.51% to 96.22%) and precision-recall curve range (99.52% to 99.73%).

In this paper, we explored the ways in which public risk perception can be more accurately predicted in the era of big data. We obtained internal characteristics and external environment predictor variables through a literature review, and then built our prediction model using the machine learning of a BP neural network via three steps: the calculation of the node number of the implication level, a performance test of the BP neural network, and the computation of the weight of every input node. Taking the public risk perception of the Sino-US trade friction and the COVID-19 pandemic in China as research cases, we found that, according to our tests, the node number of the implication level was 15 in terms of the Sino-US trade friction and 14 in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this, machine learning was conducted, through which we found that the R2 of the BP neural network prediction model was 0.88651 and 0.87125, respectively, for the two cases, which accurately predicted the public's risk perception of the data on a certain day, and simultaneously obtained the weight of every predictor variable in each case.

In view of the problem that the existing models failed to describe and represent the characteristics of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular indicators, convolution neural network was used to analyze the metabolic factors of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular. Based on convolutional neural network theory, feature extraction was carried out on the relevant parameters of the model, and the change trend of different cardiovascular and cerebrovascular indicators was studied by model optimization, theoretical analysis, and experimental verification. Relevant studies show that the value of neurons increases slowly at first and then rapidly with the increase of bias term b. And with the increase of computing time, the corresponding nonlinear characteristics are gradually reflected; so, the influence of computing time on neuron results should be considered when selecting bias term b. The gradient changes under different functions have typical symmetry, which indicates that the effects of functions on model parameters have certain cyclic characteristics. Among them, ReLU function has the largest variation range, tanh function has a relatively small curve variation range, and sigmoid function has the smallest variation range. Five indicators are selected to describe the metabolic characteristics of the disease through characteristic analysis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The onset signs have the greatest impact on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, while the corresponding metabolic characteristics have the least impact on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The study showed that the influence of different indicators on the model had typical stage characteristics, and relevant data were used to verify the accuracy of the model. Finally, the optimization model based on convolutional neural network was used to predict the metabolic characteristics of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Relevant studies show that the optimization model can better analyze the metabolic characteristics of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

Using data from the UK Biobank, COPDGene study, and Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), we examined the features of neural networks in this context and compared them with traditional regression approaches for prediction of three outcomes: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), age at smoking cessation, and log transformation of age at smoking cessation (due to age at smoking cessation being right-skewed). We used mean squared error to compare neural network and regression models, and found the models performed similarly unless the observed distribution of the phenotype was skewed, in which case the neural network had smaller mean squared error. Our results suggest neural network models have an advantage over standard regression approaches when the phenotypic distribution is skewed. However, when the distribution is not skewed, the approaches performed similarly. Our findings are relevant to studies that analyze phenotypes that are skewed by nature or where the phenotype of interest is skewed as a result of the ascertainment condition.",0.20470648619644793,other,linear regression

The 14-miRNA model efficiently discriminated tumor bearing animals from controls with 100% sensitivity down to tumor inoculums of 50,000 cells. Among early-stage patient samples, the model performed well with 73% sensitivity at 91% specificity. Applied to a population with 1% disease prevalence, we hypothesize the model would detect most early-stage ovarian cancers while maintaining a negative predictive value of 99.97% (95% CI 99.95%-99.98%).

We aimed to build a novel multivariate time series prediction model for dynamic AKI prediction in general hospitalization.
METHODS: Deidentified electronic data of all patients admitted in Sichuan Provincial Peoples Hospital during 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019 was retrospectively collected. Variables including demographics, admission variables, lab investigation variables and prescription variables were extracted. The first 50 most frequently detected lab investigation variables were selected as the predictive variables. Features within three previous days were selected to predict the risk of AKI in the next 24 h. The model was built using recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm integrated with a time series convolution module and an attention convolution module and internally validated using five-fold cross-validation. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) and recall rate were used to evaluate the performance. The model was compared with four other models built using other machine learning algorithms and published machine learning models in literature.
RESULTS: 47,960 eligible admissions were identified, among which 2694 (5.6%) admissions were complicated by AKI. Our model has an AUC of 0.908 and a recall rate of 0.869, outperforming models generated by mainstay machine learning methods and most of the published machine learning models.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an MRI technique that is sensitive to chronic active lesions, termed rim + lesions on the QSM. We present QSMRim-Net, a data imbalance-aware deep neural network that fuses lesion-level radiomic and convolutional image features for automated identification of rim + lesions on QSM.
METHODS: QSM and T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRI of the brain were collected at 3 T for 172 MS patients. Rim + lesions were manually annotated by two human experts, followed by consensus from a third expert, for a total of 177 rim + and 3986 rim negative (rim-) lesions. Our automated rim + detection algorithm, QSMRim-Net, consists of a two-branch feature extraction network and a synthetic minority oversampling network to classify rim + lesions. The first network branch is for image feature extraction from the QSM and T2-FLAIR, and the second network branch is a fully connected network for QSM lesion-level radiomic feature extraction. The oversampling network is designed to increase classification performance with imbalanced data.
RESULTS: On a lesion-level, in a five-fold cross validation framework, the proposed QSMRim-Net detected rim + lesions with a partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pROC AUC) of 0.760, where clinically relevant false positive rates of less than 0.1 were considered. The method attained an area under the precision recall curve (PR AUC) of 0.704. QSMRim-Net out-performed other state-of-the-art methods applied to the QSM on both pROC AUC and PR AUC. On a subject-level, comparing the predicted rim + lesion count and the human expert annotated count, QSMRim-Net achieved the lowest mean square error of 0.98 and the highest correlation of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.92).
CONCLUSION: This study develops a novel automated deep neural network for rim + MS lesion identification using T2-FLAIR and QSM images.",0.10725908617995804,computer vision,Unknown

Mendelian risk prediction models translate family histories into cancer risk predictions, based on knowledge of cancer susceptibility genes. These models are widely used in clinical practice to help identify high-risk individuals. Mendelian models leverage the entire family history, but they rely on many assumptions about cancer susceptibility genes that are either unrealistic or challenging to validate, due to low mutation prevalence. Training more flexible models, such as neural networks, on large databases of pedigrees can potentially lead to accuracy gains. In this paper we develop a framework to apply neural networks to family history data and investigate their ability to learn inherited susceptibility to cancer. While there is an extensive literature on neural networks and their state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, there is little work applying them to family history data. We propose adaptations of fully-connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks to pedigrees. In data simulated under Mendelian inheritance, we demonstrate that our proposed neural network models are able to achieve nearly optimal prediction performance. Moreover, when the observed family history includes misreported cancer diagnoses, neural networks are able to outperform the Mendelian BRCAPRO model embedding the correct inheritance laws. Using a large dataset of over 200,000 family histories, the Risk Service cohort, we train prediction models for future risk of breast cancer.

Accordingly, identifying protective factors and health barriers of this vulnerable group and changing the prison into an environment that can deliver health interventions tailored to the needs of inmates can provide the basis for attaining justice in health.
PURPOSE: This study builds on an artificial neural network model to determine the effect of demographic, psychological, criminological, and physical activity factors on prisoners' general health.
METHODS: The study detected the patterns between variables using a neural network with nine inputs and one output. To determine the neural network with the minimum sum of squared errors, we evaluated the performance of all neural networks using varying algorithms and numbers of neurons in the hidden layer. For this purpose, the analysis of the data of 149 prisoners aged between 16 and 61 years was performed using SPSS-22 software.
RESULTS: The optimal neural network model was useful in predicting prisoners' general health. In this model, the variables of occupation, life expectancy, age, and hope of acceptance were identified as the first most significant factors with 19.25, 17.45, 15.98, and 15.16 percentages, respectively, whereas the cause of incarceration, education level, type of drug misuse, and physical activity were the second most important factors with 8.82, 8.38, 7.91, and 7.04 percentages, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Experiencing psychosocial pressures related to incarceration is more severe for the marginalized and disadvantaged individuals, persons in very young or old age ranges, and those with no history of incarceration, which can increase the likelihood of impaired health for these inmates. Consideration of the prisoners' needs in proportion to their characteristics and provision of emotional and spiritual support of the inmates, especially in the early stages of incarceration, can help shape an effective adjustment process and select appropriate and efficient strategies.",0.1596395808900949,other,Unknown

Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop tools to understand, analyze, monitor and control further outbreaks of the disease.
METHODOLOGY: The Susceptible Infected Recovered-Particle SwarmOptimization model and the feed-forward artificial neural network model were separately developed to model COVID-19 dynamics based on daily time-series data reported by the Saudi authorities from March 2, 2020 to February 21, 2021. The collected data were divided into training and validation datasets. The effectiveness of the investigated models was evaluated by using various performance metrics. The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Particle-Swarm-Optimization model was found to well predict the cumulative infected and recovered cases and to optimally tune the contact rate and the characteristic duration of the illness. The feed-forward artificial neural network model was found to be efficient in modeling daily new and cumulative infections, recoveries and deaths.
RESULTS: The forecasts provided by the investigated models had high coefficient of determination values of more than 0.97 and low mean absolute percentage errors (around 7% on average).
CONCLUSIONS: Both the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Particle-Swarm-Optimization and feed-forward artificial neural network models were efficient in modeling COVID-19 dynamics in Saudi Arabia.

METHODS: We present a retrospective study using electronic health record data from over 700 United States hospitals. A subset of hospitals was used to develop machine learning algorithms (MLAs); the remaining hospitals served as an external test set. Three MLAs were evaluated: gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost), Deep Long Short Term Memory neural network, and one-dimensional convolutional neural network. MLA performance was evaluated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratios and likelihood ratios.
RESULTS: The development dataset contained 13,664,840 inpatient encounters with 80,046 CDI encounters; the external dataset contained 1,149,088 inpatient encounters with 7,107 CDI encounters. The highest AUROCs were achieved for XGB, Deep Long Short Term Memory neural network, and one-dimensional convolutional neural network via abstaining from use of specialized training techniques, resampling in isolation, and resampling and output bias in combination, respectively.

Methods that incorporate both individual-level and sample-level effects are critical to using these data to its full predictive capacity. Neural networks are powerful tools for prediction, but many assume input observations are independent even when they are clustered or correlated in some way, such as in longitudinal data. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) provide a flexible framework for modeling longitudinal data but have poor predictive power particularly when the data are highly nonlinear. We propose a generalized neural network mixed model that replaces the linear fixed effect in a GLMM with the output of a feed-forward neural network. The model simultaneously accounts for the correlation structure and complex nonlinear relationship between input variables and outcomes, and it utilizes the predictive power of neural networks.

In this study, 74 surgically treated gynecologic tumor patients were randomly selected from within the hospital as the study population and were divided into study and control groups. For this purpose, the whole-group random sampling method is utilized to compare the postoperative incisional infection rates of the two groups, analyze their influencing factors, and develop quality nursing interventions. In this paper, a breast cancer diagnosis prediction model was developed by combining the self-attentive mechanism. The preprocessing work such as data quantification and normalization was performed first which is followed by adding the preprocessed data to the self-attentive mechanism. This model has solved the problem that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) could not extract and calculate the features at the same time. Likewise, it has solved the drawback that the RNN could not consider global features at the same time when extracting the features, and then, the feature matrix extracted by the self-attentive mechanism was added to the adaptive neural network. The adaptive neural network model for breast cancer diagnosis prediction was constructed and, finally, relevant parameters of the adaptive neural network model were adjusted according to different tasks to make the model performance optimal. Experimental results showed that the postoperative incision infection rate of patients in the study group was 2.70%, which was significantly lower than that of 21.62% in the control group (P &lt; 0.05).

METHODS AND RESULTS: We undertook a derivation and internal validation study to develop a risk prediction model for use in patients being investigated for possible PE. The machine learning technique, generalized logistic regression using elastic net, was chosen following an assessment of seven machine learning techniques and on the basis that it optimized the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and Brier score. Models were developed both with and without the addition of D-dimer. A total of 3347 patients were included in the study of whom, 219 (6.5%) had PE. Four clinical variables (O2 saturation, previous deep venous thrombosis or PE, immobilization or surgery, and alternative diagnosis equal or more likely than PE) plus D-dimer contributed to the machine learning models. The addition of D-dimer improved the AUC by 0.16 (95% confidence interval 0.13-0.19), from 0.73 to 0.89 (0.87-0.91) and decreased the Brier score by 14% (10-18%). More could be ruled out with a higher positive likelihood ratio than by the Wells score combined with D-dimer, revised Geneva score combined with D-dimer, or the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria score. Machine learning with D-dimer maintained a low-false-negative rate at a true-negative rate of nearly 53%, which was better performance than any of the other alternatives.

In order to accelerate knowledge discovery, the AO Spine RECODE-DCM project has recently established the top priorities for DCM research. Uptake of these priorities within the research community will require their effective dissemination, which can be supported by identifying key opinion leaders (KOLs). In this paper, we aim to identify KOLs using artificial intelligence. We produce and explore a DCM co-authorship network, to characterise researchers' impact within the research field.
METHODS: Through a bibliometric analysis of 1674 scientific papers in the DCM field, a co-authorship network was created. For each author, statistics about their connections to the co-authorship network (and so the nature of their collaboration) were generated. Using these connectedness statistics, a neural network was used to predict H-Index for each author (as a proxy for research impact). The neural network was retrospectively validated on an unseen author set.
RESULTS: DCM research is regionally clustered, with strong collaboration across some international borders (e.g., North America) but not others (e.g., Western Europe). In retrospective validation, the neural network achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.86 (p<0.0001) between the true and predicted H-Index of each author. Thus, author impact can be accurately predicted using only the nature of an author's collaborations.
DISCUSSION: Analysis of the neural network shows that the nature of collaboration strongly impacts an author's research visibility, and therefore suitability as a KOL. This also suggests greater collaboration within the DCM field could help to improve both individual research visibility and global synergy.",0.1639557800935651,other,Unknown

The advanced technological methods of big data will also give full play to the advantages of tapping the potential of talents and actively improve the success rate of grassroots young athletes. This paper proposes an improved Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) algorithm for the optimization of radial basis function (RBF) neural network parameters. The basic structure of RBF neural network is introduced, and the influence of parameters on the performance of RBF neural network is analyzed. The optimization method of RBF neural network parameters is analyzed, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is selected as the parameter optimization method of RBF neural network. In addition, an improved APSO algorithm is proposed according to the advantages and disadvantages of PSO and compared with other PSO algorithms. Experimental results show that the improved PSO algorithm has better accuracy. The improved PSO algorithm is applied to the parameter optimization of RBF neural network, and the experimental results prove the superiority of the proposed method. By weighting the second-level indicators, the weights of the second-level indicators of athletes' competitive ability are in order of skill, athletic quality, psychological ability, and artistic expression. Skills are the main factors that determine the level of competitive ability. Sports quality and psychological ability are important guarantees for supporting the normal performance of skills. Artistic expressiveness is a supplementary factor for competitive ability. The various elements cooperate with each other and interact with each other. The indicators do not exist alone but cooperate with each other to support the formation of the entire athletic ability system. In the content of the competitive ability index of excellent athletes, technical ability is the core, and sports quality, psychological ability, and artistic performance ability ultimately exist to serve the improvement of technical ability. The competition scores of the 100 athletes counted in this article are all above 9.0 points. The difference between APSO-RBF's action quality scores of 100 athletes and the real value is less than 3%. In terms of movement difficulty, the APSO-RBF evaluated athletes' scores are close to 1.65 points, which is basically the same as the real value.",0.14066279705128162,other,Unknown

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of the 2013 Nationwide Readmissions Database included children 5 to 18 years old with a primary diagnosis of asthma. The primary outcome was time to asthma readmission in the Cox model, and readmission within 180 days in logistic regression. A basic neural network construction with 2 hidden layers and multiple replications considered all dataset variables and potential variable interactions to predict 180-day readmissions. Logistic regression and neural-network models were compared on area-under-the receiver-operating curve.
RESULTS: Of 18,489 pediatric asthma hospitalizations, 1858 were readmitted within 180 days. In Cox and logistic models, longer index length of stay, public insurance, and nonwinter index admission seasons were associated with readmission risk, whereas micropolitan county was protective. In neural-network modeling, 9 factors were significantly associated with readmissions. Four overlapped with the Cox model (nonwinter-month admission, long length of stay, public insurance, and micropolitan hospitals), whereas 5 were unique (age, hospital bed number, teaching-hospital status, weekend index admission, and complex chronic conditions). The area under the curve was 0.592 for logistic regression and 0.637 for the neural network.

Data consisting of 120 subjects were divided into a training-validation data set (96 subjects) and a testing data set (24 subjects). Data was learned by using a 9-layer artificial neural network (ANN), and the model was validated using 10-fold cross-validation. The model performance was assessed by a confusion matrix in the validating data set. The receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed, and the area under the curve (AUC) was also calculated. Pathology type, presence of hypertension, presence of diabetes, receiving of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, body mass index, and axillary lymph node (LN) management (i.e., sentinel LN biopsy and axillary LN dissection) were selected as predictive factors in a model developed from the neural network algorithm. The model yielded an AUC of 0.760, which corresponded with a level of acceptable discrimination. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values were 100%, 52.9%, 66.7%, 46.7%, and 100%, respectively.

Epub 2021 Sep 3.,Phillips NS,Brain Connect,2022,2021/07/02,PMC9131353,,10.1089/brain.2021.0049,"Background: Patients with breast cancer frequently report cognitive impairment both during and after completion of therapy. Evidence suggests that cancer-related cognitive impairments are related to widespread neural network dysfunction. The default mode network (DMN) is a large conserved network that plays a critical role in integrating the functions of various neural systems. Disruption of the network may play a key role in the development of cognitive impairment. Methods: We compared neuroimaging and neurocognitive data from 43 newly diagnosed primary breast cancer patients (mean age = 48, standard deviation [SD] = 8.9 years) and 50 frequency-matched healthy female controls (mean age = 50, SD = 10 years) before treatment and 1 year after treatment completion. Functional and effective connectivity measures of the DMN were obtained using graph theory and Bayesian network analysis methods, respectively. Results: Compared with healthy females, the breast cancer group displayed higher global efficiency and path length post-treatment (p &lt; 0.03, corrected). Breast cancer survivors showed significantly lower performance on measures of verbal memory, attention, and verbal fluency (p &lt; 0.05) at both time points. Within the DMN, local brain network organization, as measured by edge-betweenness centralities, was significantly altered in the breast cancer group compared with controls at both time points (p &lt; 0.0001, corrected), with several connections showing a significant group-by-time effect (p &lt; 0.003, corrected). Effective connectivity demonstrated significantly altered patterns of neuronal coupling in patients with breast cancer (p &lt; 0.05). Significant correlations were seen between hormone blockade therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy cycles, memory, and verbal fluency test and edge-betweenness centralities. Discussion: This pattern of altered network organization in the default mode is believed to result in reduced network efficiency and disrupted communication. Subregions of the DMN, the orbital prefrontal cortex and posterior memory network, appear to be at the center of this disruption and this could inform future interventions. Impact statement This prospective study is the first to investigate how post-treatment changes in functional and effective connectivity in the regions of default mode network are related to cancer therapy and measures of memory and verbal learning in breast cancer patients. We demonstrate that the interactions between treatment, brain connectivity, and neurocognitive outcomes coalesce around a subgroup of brain structures in the orbital frontal and parietal lobe. This would suggest that interventions that target these regions may improve neurocognitive outcomes in breast cancer survivors.",0.17217536099423472,other,Unknown

Recently, there has been significant interest in using neural networks to forecast future glucose values from interstitial measurements collected by continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). While prediction accuracy continues to improve, in this work we investigated the effect of physiological sensor location on neural network blood glucose forecasting. We used clinical data from patients with Type 2 Diabetes who wore blinded FreeStyle Libre Pro CGMs (Abbott) on both their right and left arms continuously for 12 weeks. We trained patient-specific prediction algorithms to test the effect of sensor location on neural network forecasting (N = 13, Female = 6, Male = 7). In 10 of our 13 patients, we found at least one significant (P &lt; .05) increase in forecasting error in algorithms which were tested with data taken from a different location than data which was used for training. These reported results were independent from other noticeable physiological differences between subjects (eg, height, age, weight, blood pressure) and independent from overall variance in the data.

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the convolutional neural network compared with the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer using ultrasound images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2019 to September 2019, seven hundred sixty thyroid nodules (≥10 mm) in 757 patients were diagnosed as benign or malignant through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or an operation. Experienced radiologists assessed the sonographic descriptors of the nodules, and 1 of 5 American College of Radiology TI-RADS categories was assigned. The convolutional neural network provided malignancy risk percentages for nodules based on sonographic images. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated with cutoff values using the Youden index and compared between the convolutional neural network and the American College of Radiology TI-RADS. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were also compared.
RESULTS: Of 760 nodules, 176 (23.2%) were malignant. At an optimal threshold derived from the Youden index, sensitivity and negative predictive values were higher with the convolutional neural network than with the American College of Radiology TI-RADS (81.8% versus 73.9%, P = .009; 94.0% versus 92.2%, P = .046).

Different factors such as gender, age, education, place of residence, etc. can influence this variable. Nevertheless, the influence of a multitude of factors involved in behavioral phenomena cannot often be controlled.
PURPOSE: Therefore, some difficulty may often raise in finding associations between these variables using regression models as regression models are built on restrictive assumptions.
METHODS: In these cases, models such as artificial neural networks are excellent alternatives to regression models. In this study, the neural network model was used in SPSS software to predict the pattern held among the variables of age, gender, occupation, marital status, and education for predicting the EI of 901 individuals aged from 17 to 73 years.
RESULTS: The appropriate neural network model for EI prediction is a hyperbolic tangent transfer function with two neurons in the hidden layer and a sigmoid transfer function in the output layer. This network was able to predict EI in most of its dimensions with significant correlations and could demonstrate the neural network's advantage over regression models in predicting EI using sociological variables.
CONCLUSION: This model is able to estimate the EI level in different occupational, educational, gender, and age groups, and provide the ground for planning to address potential deficiencies in each group.",0.1683406198423555,other,Unknown

We updated the weights of this model by transfer learning using PPG data derived from the Empatica E4 wristwatch worn by 105 subjects in the 'Emory Twin Study Follow-up' (ETSF) database, for whom overnight polysomnographic (PSG) scoring was available. The relative performance of PPG, and actigraphy (Act), plus combinations of these two signals, with and without transfer learning was assessed.Main results.The performance of our model with transfer learning showed higher accuracy (1-9 percentage points) and Cohen's Kappa (0.01-0.13) than those without transfer learning for every classification category. Statistically significant, though relatively small, incremental differences in accuracy occurred for every classification category as tested with the McNemar test. The out-of-sample classification performance using features from PPG and actigraphy for four-class classification was Accuracy (Acc) = 68.62% and Kappa = 0.44. For two-class classification, the performance was Acc = 81.49% and Kappa = 0.58.Significance.We proposed a combined PPG and actigraphy-based sleep stage classification approach using transfer learning from a large ECG sleep database. Results demonstrate that the transfer learning approach improves estimates of sleep state.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether contemporary machine learning methods can facilitate risk prediction by including a larger number of variables and identifying complex relationships between predictors and outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used the American College of Cardiology Chest Pain-MI Registry to identify all AMI hospitalizations between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from February 1, 2018, to October 22, 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Three machine learning models were developed and validated to predict in-hospital mortality based on patient comorbidities, medical history, presentation characteristics, and initial laboratory values. Models were developed based on extreme gradient descent boosting (XGBoost, an interpretable model), a neural network, and a meta-classifier model. Their accuracy was compared against the current standard developed using a logistic regression model in a validation sample.
RESULTS: A total of 755 402 patients (mean [SD] age, 65 [13] years; 495 202 [65.5%] male) were identified during the study period. In independent validation, 2 machine learning models, gradient descent boosting and meta-classifier (combination including inputs from gradient descent boosting and a neural network), marginally improved discrimination compared with logistic regression (C statistic, 0.90 for best performing machine learning model vs 0.89 for logistic regression). Nearly perfect calibration in independent validation data was found in the XGBoost (slope of predicted to observed events, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99-1.04) and the meta-classifier model (slope of predicted-to-observed events, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99-1.02), with more precise classification across the risk spectrum. The XGBoost model reclassified 32 393 of 121 839 individuals (27%) and the meta-classifier model reclassified 30 836 of 121 839 individuals (25%) deemed at moderate to high risk for death in logistic regression as low risk, which were more consistent with the observed event rates.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study using a large national registry, none of the tested machine learning models were associated with substantive improvement in the discrimination of in-hospital mortality after AMI, limiting their clinical utility. However, compared with logistic regression, XGBoost and meta-classifier models, but not the neural network, offered improved resolution of risk for high-risk individuals.",0.10544551832529832,other,logistic regression

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of glioma presence and tumor characteristics on resting-state functional connectivity and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations of the salience network, a key neural network associated with cognition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with glioma (mean age, 48.74 [SD, 14.32] years) who underwent resting-state fMRI were compared with 31 healthy controls (mean age, 49.68 [SD, 15.54] years). We identified 4 salience network ROIs: left/right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and left/right anterior insula. Average salience network resting-state functional connectivity and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations within the 4 salience network ROIs were computed.
RESULTS: Patients with gliomas showed decreased overall salience network resting-state functional connectivity (P = .001) and increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in all salience network ROIs (P &lt; .01) except in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Compared with controls, patients with left-sided gliomas showed increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (P = .002) and right anterior insula (P &lt; .001), and patients with right-sided gliomas showed increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the left anterior insula (P = .002). Anterior tumors were associated with decreased salience network resting-state functional connectivity (P &lt; .001) and increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the right anterior insula, left anterior insula, and right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.

The right anterior insula showed increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in patients with grade II and IV gliomas compared with controls (P &lt; .01).
CONCLUSIONS: By demonstrating decreased resting-state functional connectivity and an increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations related to the salience network in patients with glioma, this study adds to our understanding of the neurobiology underpinning observable cognitive deficits in these patients. In addition to more conventional functional connectivity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations is a promising functional-imaging biomarker of tumor-induced vascular and neural pathology.",0.10844851735687489,other,Unknown

Epub 2020 Dec 8.,Pfob A,Eur J Cancer,2021,2020/12/11,,,10.1016/j.ejca.2020.11.006,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant systemic treatment elicits a pathologic complete response (pCR) in about 35% of women with breast cancer. In such cases, breast surgery may be considered overtreatment. We evaluated multivariate algorithms using patient, tumor, and vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) variables to identify patients with breast pCR.
METHODS: We developed and tested four multivariate algorithms: a logistic regression with elastic net penalty, an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and neural network. We used data from 457 women, randomly partitioned into training and test set (2:1), enrolled in three trials with stage 1-3 breast cancer, undergoing VAB before surgery. False-negative rate (FNR) and specificity were the main outcome measures. The best performing algorithm was validated in an independent fourth trial.
RESULTS: In the test set (n = 152), the logistic regression with elastic net penalty, XGboost tree, SVM, and neural network revealed an FNR of 1.2% (1 of 85 patients with missed residual cancer). Specificity of the logistic regression with elastic net penalty was 52.2% (35 of 67 women with surgically confirmed breast pCR identified), of the XGBoost tree 55.2% (37 of 67), of SVM 62.7% (42 of 67), and of the neural network 67.2% (45 of 67). External validation (n = 50) of the neural network showed an FNR of 0% (0 of 27) and a specificity of 65.2% (15 of 23). Area under the ROC curve for the neural network was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-1.00).

However, at present, it has limited treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To overcome this issue, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model of COVID-19, named EDRnet (ensemble learning model based on deep neural network and random forest models), to predict in-hospital mortality using a routine blood sample at the time of hospital admission.
METHODS: We selected 28 blood biomarkers and used the age and gender information of patients as model inputs. To improve the mortality prediction, we adopted an ensemble approach combining deep neural network and random forest models. We trained our model with a database of blood samples from 361 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and applied it to 106 COVID-19 patients in three Korean medical institutions.
RESULTS: In the testing data sets, EDRnet provided high sensitivity (100%), specificity (91%), and accuracy (92%). To extend the number of patient data points, we developed a web application (BeatCOVID19) where anyone can access the model to predict mortality and can register his or her own blood laboratory results.

Current risk stratification methods are imperfect, limiting identification of high-risk patients with HCM. Our aim was to improve the prediction of adverse cardiac events in patients with HCM using machine learning methods.
METHODS: We applied modern machine learning methods to a prospective cohort of adults with HCM. The outcome was a composite of death due to heart failure, heart transplant, and sudden death. As the reference model, we constructed logistic regression model using known predictors. We determined 20 predictive characteristics based on random forest classification and a priori knowledge, and developed 4 machine learning models. Results Of 183 patients in the cohort, the mean age was 53 (SD = 17) years and 45% were female. During the median follow-up of 2.2 years (interquartile range, 0.6-3.8), 33 subjects (18%) developed an outcome event, the majority of which (85%) was heart transplant. The predictive accuracy of the reference model was 73% (sensitivity 76%, specificity 72%) while that of the machine learning model was 85% (e.g., sensitivity 88%, specificity 84% with elastic net regression). All 4 machine learning models significantly outperformed the reference model - e.g., area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve 0.79 with the reference model vs. 0.93 with elastic net regression (p < 0.001).

Our aim was to develop a machine learning-based model to predict mortality using Fahad-Liaqat-Ahmad Intensive Machine (FLAIM) framework. We hypothesized machine learning could be applied to critically ill patients and would outperform currently used mortality scores.
METHODS: The current Deep-FLAIM model evaluates the statistically significant risk factors and then supply these risk factors to deep neural network to predict mortality in trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We analyzed adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to the trauma ICU in the publicly available database Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III version 1.4. The first phase selection of risk factor was done using Cox-regression univariate and multivariate analyses. In the second phase, we applied deep neural network and other traditional machine learning models like Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree Model, and k-nearest neighbor models.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 3,041 trauma patients admitted to the trauma surgery ICU. We observed that several clinical and laboratory-based variables were statistically significant for both univariate and multivariate analyses while others were not. With most significant being serum anion gap (hazard ratio [HR], 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.94-3.11), sodium (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.61-2.77), and chloride (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.69-2.64) abnormalities on laboratories, while clinical variables included the diagnosis of sepsis (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.23-3.37), Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.32-3.76). And Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria (HR. 1.41; 95% CI, 1.24-1.26).

Vitamin D supplements are a potentially important public health intervention, but the response to supplementation varies between individuals.
AIM: We aimed to assess the association between several neuropsychological parameters and the magnitude of response to vitamin D supplementation using an artificial neural network method.
METHODS: Neuropsychological function was assessed in 619 participants using standard questionnaires. The study participants received vitamin D capsules containing 50,000 IU vitamin D per week over 9 weeks. To assess the relationship between responsiveness to vitamin D supplements and the impact on these neuropsychological parameters, the best-performing artificial neural network algorithms were selected from a combination of different transfer functions in hidden and output layers and variable numbers of hidden layers (between two and 50). The performance of the artificial neural network algorithm was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis and variables of importance were identified.
RESULTS: The artificial neural network algorithm with sigmoid transfer function in both hidden and output layers could predict responsiveness to vitamin D supplementation effectively. The sensitivity and specificity were between 0.60 and 0.70 and 0.66 and 0.70, respectively. Cognitive abilities (42.5%), basal vitamin D (21.3%), body mass index (9.5%), and daytime sleepiness (8%) are the most widely used variables to predict changes in serum vitamin D levels.

Given relatively small patient sample (as compared with high dimensional imaging features), identifying potential prognostic imaging biomarkers is typically challenging. We aimed to develop robust machine learning methods for patient survival prediction using pre-treatment quantitative CT image features for a subgroup of head-and-neck cancer patients.
METHODS: Three neural network models, including back propagation (BP), Genetic Algorithm-Back Propagation (GA-BP), and Probabilistic Genetic Algorithm-Back Propagation (PGA-BP) neural networks were trained to simulate association between patient survival and radiomics data in radiotherapy. To evaluate the models, a subgroup of 59 head-and-neck patients with primary cancers in oral tongue area were utilized. Quantitative image features were extracted from planning CT images, a novel t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method was used to remove irrelevant and redundant image features before fed into the network models. 80% patients were used to train the models, and remaining 20% were used for evaluation.
RESULTS: Of the three supervised machine-learning methods studied, PGA-BP yielded the best predictive performance.

METHODS: In a population-based birth cohort of 902 healthy Finnish children, we applied deep neural network models to investigate the relationship between the nasal microbiota (measured by 16S rRNA gene sequencing at up to three time points) and child age during the first 24 months. We also performed stratified analyses according to antibiotic exposure during the age period 0-2 months.
RESULTS: The dense deep neural network analysis successfully modelled the relationship between 232 bacterial genera and child age with a mean absolute error of 4.3 (95%CI 4.0-4.7) months. Similarly, the recurrent neural network analysis also successfully modelled the relationship between 215 genera and child age with a mean absolute error of 0.45 (95%CI 0.42-0.47) months.

A synthetic experiment was then conducted that linked two separately trained neural networks: a multitask model estimating cancer hallmark gene expression from TET1 expression, and a survival neural network. This experiment quantified the mediation of the TET1 survival effect through eight cancer hallmarks: apoptosis, cell cycle, cell death, cell motility, DNA repair, immune response, two phosphorylation pathways, and a randomized gene sets. Immune response, DNA repair, and apoptosis displayed greater mediation than the randomized gene set. Cell motility was inversely associated with only 12.5% mediated concordance.

Thus, this study was conducted to assess and compare the performance of four machine-learning methods in modeling and forecasting brucellosis time series data based on climatic parameters.
METHODS: In this cohort study, human brucellosis cases and climatic parameters were analyzed on a monthly basis for the Qazvin province-located in northwestern Iran- over a period of 9 years (2010-2018). The data were classified into two subsets of education (80%) and testing (20%). Artificial neural network methods (radial basis function and multilayer perceptron), support vector machine and random forest were fitted to each set. Performance analysis of the models were done using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Root Error (MARE), and R2 criteria.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of the brucellosis in Qazvin province was 27.43 per 100,000 during 2010-2019. Based on our results, the values of the RMSE (0.22), MAE (0.175), MARE (0.007) criteria were smaller for the multilayer perceptron neural network than their values in the other three models. Moreover, the R2 (0.99) value was bigger in this model. Therefore, the multilayer perceptron neural network exhibited better performance in forecasting the studied data.

CONCLUSIONS: The multilayer perceptron neural network can be used as an effective method in detecting the behavioral trend of brucellosis over time. Nevertheless, further studies focusing on the application and comparison of these methods are needed to detect the most appropriate forecast method for this disease.",0.1657141443575313,other,"random forest, support vector machine"

METHOD: We compared the capabilities of a single hidden layer neural network of 12 nodes to those of a discrete-feature discrimination approach with the goal being to predict the likelihood of a given patient developing significant hypotension under spinal anesthesia when undergoing a Cesarean section (C/S). Physiological input information was derived from a non-invasive blood pressure device (Caretaker [CT]) that utilizes a finger cuff to measure blood pressure and other hemodynamic parameters via pulse contour analysis. Receiver-operator-curve/area-under-curve analyses were used to compare performance.
RESULTS: The results presented here suggest that a neural network approach (Area Under Curve [AUC] = 0.89 [p < 0.001]), at least at the implementation level of a clinically relevant prediction algorithm, may be superior to a discrete feature quantification approach (AUC = 0.87 [p < 0.001]), providing implicit access to a plurality of features and combinations thereof. In addition, the expansion of the approach to include the submission of other physiological data signals, such as heart rate variability, to the network can be readily envisioned.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study has demonstrated that increased coherence in Arterial Stiffness (AS) variability obtained from the pulse wave analysis of a continuous non-invasive blood pressure device appears to be an effective predictor of hypotension after spinal anesthesia in the obstetrics population undergoing C/S. This allowed us to predict specific dosing thresholds of phenylephrine required to maintain systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg.",0.13274848173792472,other,Unknown

RECENT FINDINGS: Machine-learning (ML) techniques have recently been applied to substance use disorder (SUD) data for multiple predictive applications including detecting current abuse, assessing future risk and predicting treatment success. These models cover a wide range of machine-learning techniques and data types including physiological measures, longitudinal surveys, treatment outcomes, national surveys, medical records and social media.
SUMMARY: The application of machine-learning models to substance use disorder data shows significant promise, with some use cases and data types showing high predictive accuracy, particularly for models of physiological and behavioral measures for predicting current substance use, portending potential clinical diagnostic applications; however, these results are uneven, with some models performing poorly or at chance, a limitation likely reflecting insufficient data and/or weak validation methods. The field will likely benefit from larger and more multimodal datasets, greater standardization of data recording and rigorous testing protocols as well as greater use of modern deep neural network models applied to multimodal unstructured datasets.",0.11246575458209224,other,Unknown

The status of the infected cases can be determined basing on the treatment process along with several other factors. This research aims to build a classifier prediction model to predict the status of recovered and death coronavirus CovID-19 patients in South Korea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Artificial neural network principle is used to classify the collected data between February 20, 2020 and March 9, 2020. The proposed classifier used different seven variables, namely, country, infection reason, sex, group, confirmation date, birth year, and region. The most effective variables on recovered and fatal cases are analyzed based on the neural network model.
RESULTS: The results found that the proposed predictive classifier efficiently predicted recovered and death cases. Besides, it is found that discovering the infection reason would increase the probability to recover the patient. This indicates that the virus might be controllable based on infection reasons. In addition, the earlier discovery of the disease affords better control and a higher probability of being recovered.
CONCLUSIONS: Our recommendation is to use this model to predict the status of the patients globally.",0.11757124064278865,other,Unknown

Grading systems are often used, but are unreliable as domain experts disagree on disease severity category thresholds. These discrete categories also do not reflect the underlying continuous spectrum of disease severity. To address these issues, we developed a convolutional Siamese neural network approach to evaluate disease severity at single time points and change between longitudinal patient visits on a continuous spectrum. We demonstrate this in two medical imaging domains: retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in retinal photographs and osteoarthritis in knee radiographs. Our patient cohorts consist of 4861 images from 870 patients in the Imaging and Informatics in Retinopathy of Prematurity (i-ROP) cohort study and 10,012 images from 3021 patients in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST), both of which feature longitudinal imaging data. Multiple expert clinician raters ranked 100 retinal images and 100 knee radiographs from excluded test sets for severity of ROP and osteoarthritis, respectively. The Siamese neural network output for each image in comparison to a pool of normal reference images correlates with disease severity rank (ρ = 0.87 for ROP and ρ = 0.89 for osteoarthritis), both within and between the clinical grading categories. Thus, this output can represent the continuous spectrum of disease severity at any single time point. The difference in these outputs can be used to show change over time. Alternatively, paired images from the same patient at two time points can be directly compared using the Siamese neural network, resulting in an additional continuous measure of change between images. Importantly, our approach does not require manual localization of the pathology of interest and requires only a binary label for training (same versus different). The location of disease and site of change detected by the algorithm can be visualized using an occlusion sensitivity map-based approach. For a longitudinal binary change detection task, our Siamese neural networks achieve test set receiving operator characteristic area under the curves (AUCs) of up to 0.90 in evaluating ROP or knee osteoarthritis change, depending on the change detection strategy. The overall performance on this binary task is similar compared to a conventional convolutional deep-neural network trained for multi-class classification. Our results demonstrate that convolutional Siamese neural networks can be a powerful tool for evaluating the continuous spectrum of disease severity and change in medical imaging.",0.14127225988288883,computer vision,Unknown

The incidence and mortality associated with PCa has been rapidly increasing in China recently.
METHODS: Multiple diagnostic models of human PCa were developed based on Taylor database by combining the artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the ability of PCa diagnosis. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select feature genes as numerical encoded parameters that reflect cancer, metastatic, or normal samples. Back propagation (BP) neural network and learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network were used to build different Cancer/Normal, Primary/Metastatic, and Gleason Grade diagnostic models.
RESULTS: The performance of these modeling approaches was evaluated by predictive accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). By observing the statistically significant parameters of the three training sets, our Cancer/Normal, Primary/Metastatic, and Gleason Grade models' with ACC and AUC can be drawn (97.33%, 0.9832), (99.17%, 0.9952), and (90.48%, 0.8742), respectively.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that our diagnostic models of human PCa based on Taylor database combining the feature gene expression profiling data and artificial intelligence algorithms might act as a powerful tool for diagnosing PCa. Gleason Grade diagnostic models were used as novel prognostic diagnosis models for biochemical recurrence-free survival and overall survival, which might be helpful in the prognostic diagnosis of PCa in patients.",0.1011234601218801,other,PCa

OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of recurrent neural networks, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, and gradient boosted trees, with logistic regression and feedforward neural networks.
METHODS: The modeling dataset contained 3548 persons that died by suicide and 35,480 persons that did not die by suicide between 2000 and 2016. 101 predictors were selected, and these were assembled for each of the 40 quarters (10 years) prior to the quarter of death, resulting in 4040 predictors in total for each person. Model configurations were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: The optimal recurrent neural network model configuration (AUC: 0.8407), one-dimensional convolutional neural network configuration (AUC: 0.8419), and XGB model configuration (AUC: 0.8493) all outperformed logistic regression (AUC: 0.8179). In addition to superior discrimination, the optimal XGB model configuration also achieved superior calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the models developed in this study showed promise, further research is needed to determine the performance limits of statistical and machine learning models that quantify suicide risk, and to develop prediction models optimized for implementation in clinical settings. It appears that the XGB model class is the most promising in terms of discrimination, calibration, and computational expense.

Early stages of brain injury may be clinically silent but potentially measurable via neuroimaging. A total of 40 subjects (20 HIV positive and 20 age-matched controls) volunteered for the study. All subjects underwent a standard battery of neuropsychological tests used for the clinical diagnosis of HAND. Fourteen HIV+ and five healthy subjects showed signs of neurological impairment. Connectivity was computed using mutual connectivity analysis (MCA) with generalized radial basis function neural network, a framework for quantifying non-linear connectivity as well as conventional correlation from 160 regional time-series that were extracted based on the Dosenbach (DOS) atlas. We subsequently applied graph theoretic as well as network analysis approaches for characterizing the connectivity matrices obtained and localizing between-group differences. We focused on trying to detect cognitive impairment using the subset of 29 (14 subjects with HAND and 15 cognitively normal controls) subjects. For the global analysis, significant differences (p < 0.05) were seen in the variance in degree, modularity and Smallworldness. Regional analysis revealed changes occurring mainly in portions of the lateral occipital cortex and the cingulate cortex. Furthermore, using Network Based Statistics (NBS), we uncovered an affected sub-network of 19 nodes comprising predominantly of regions of the default mode network. Similar analysis using the conventional correlation method revealed no significant results at a global scale, while regional analysis shows some differences spread across resting state networks. These results suggest that there is a subtle reorganization occurring in the topology of brain networks in HAND, which can be captured using improved connectivity analysis.",0.12164220222826291,other,Unknown

People with diabetes who are not treated and controlled in time may have various complications, such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetic foot disorders, which not only seriously affect the quality of life of people with diabetes but also impose a heavy burden on families and society. Therefore, prevention and control of type 2 diabetes is of great significance.
METHODS: We constructed a logistic regression model, a neural network model and a decision tree model to analyse the risk factors for type 2 diabetes and then compared the prediction accuracy of the different models by calculating the area under the relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve and back-inputting the data into the model.
RESULTS: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in 4177 subjects who were not diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was 9.31%. The most influential factors associated with type 2 diabetes were triglyceride (TG) ≥ 1.17 mmol/L (odds ratio (OR) =2.233), age ≥ 70 years (OR = 1.734), hypertension (OR = 1.703), alcohol consumption (OR = 1.674), and total cholesterol≥5.2 mmol/L (TC) (OR = 1.463).

The differences in the AUCs after back propagation (BP) of the neural network model, logistic regression model and decision tree model were statistically significant (P < 0.05).

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using longitudinal electronic health record data, we assessed the relative performance of machine learning models trained to detect a future diagnosis of heart failure in primary care patients. Model performance was assessed in relation to data parameters defined by the combination of different data domains (data diversity), the number of patient records in the training data set (data quantity), the number of encounters per patient (data density), the prediction window length, and the observation window length (ie, the time period before the prediction window that is the source of features for prediction). Data on 4370 incident heart failure cases and 30 132 group-matched controls were used. Recurrent neural network model performance was superior under a variety of conditions that included (1) when data were less diverse (eg, a single data domain like medication or vital signs) given the same training size; (2) as data quantity increased; (3) as density increased; (4) as the observation window length increased; and (5) as the prediction window length decreased. When all data domains were used, the performance of recurrent neural network models increased in relation to the quantity of data used (ie, up to 100% of the data). When data are sparse (ie, fewer features or low dimension), model performance is lower, but a much smaller training set size is required to achieve optimal performance compared with conditions where data are more diverse and includes more features.
CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent neural networks are effective for predicting a future diagnosis of heart failure given sufficient training set size. Model performance appears to continue to improve in direct relation to training set size.",0.13830338269202536,other,Unknown

We aimed to develop predictive models to identify risk factors for type 2 diabetes, which could help facilitate early diagnosis and intervention and also reduce medical costs.
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data on 138,146 participants, including 20,467 with type 2 diabetes, from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We built several machine learning models for predicting type 2 diabetes, including support vector machine, decision tree, logistic regression, random forest, neural network, and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers. We used univariable and multivariable weighted logistic regression models to investigate the associations of potential risk factors with type 2 diabetes.
RESULTS: All predictive models for type 2 diabetes achieved a high area under the curve (AUC), ranging from 0.7182 to 0.7949. Although the neural network model had the highest accuracy (82.4%), specificity (90.2%), and AUC (0.7949), the decision tree model had the highest sensitivity (51.6%) for type 2 diabetes. We found that people who slept 9 or more hours per day (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.25) or had checkup frequency of less than 1 year (aOR = 2.31, 95% CI, 1.86-2.85) had higher risk for type 2 diabetes.
CONCLUSION: Of the 8 predictive models, the neural network model gave the best model performance with the highest AUC value; however, the decision tree model is preferred for initial screening for type 2 diabetes because it had the highest sensitivity and, therefore, detection rate. We confirmed previously reported risk factors and also identified sleeping time and frequency of checkup as 2 new potential risk factors related to type 2 diabetes.",0.11284235402048003,other,"Naive Bayes, random forest, decision tree, support vector machine, logistic regression"

In this paper, we utilized Google Trends search volumes for behavioral forecasting of national suicide rates in Ireland between 2004 and 2015. Official suicide rates are recorded by the Central Statistics Office in Ireland. While similar investigations using Google trends data have been carried out in other jurisdictions (e.g., United Kingdom, United Stated of America), such research had not yet been completed in Ireland. We compiled a collection of suicide- and depression-related search terms suggested by Google Trends and manually sourced from the literature. Monthly search rate terms at different lags were compared with suicide occurrences to determine the degree of correlation. Following two approaches based on vector autoregression and neural network autoregression, we achieved mean absolute error values between 4.14 and 9.61 when incorporating search query data, with the highest performance for the neural network approach. The application of this process to United Kingdom suicide and search query data showed similar results, supporting the benefit of Google Trends, neural network approach, and the applied search terms to forecast suicide risk increase.

Epub 2019 Jul 30.,Sanderson M,J Affect Disord,2019,2019/08/09,,,10.1016/j.jad.2019.07.063,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide. With the increasing volume of administrative health care data, there is an opportunity to evaluate whether machine learning models can improve upon statistical models for quantifying suicide risk.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative performance of logistic regression and single hidden layer feedforward neural network models that quantify suicide risk with predictors available in administrative health care system data.
METHODS: The modeling dataset contained 3548 persons that died by suicide and 35,480 persons that did not die by suicide between 2000 and 2016. 101 predictors were selected, and these were assembled for each of the 40 quarters (10 years) prior to the quarter of death, resulting in 4040 predictors in total for each person. Logistic regression and single hidden layer feedforward neural network model configurations were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: The optimal feedforward neural network model configuration (AUC: 0.8352) outperformed logistic regression (AUC: 0.8179).
LIMITATIONS: Many important predictors are not available in administrative data and this likely places a limit on how well prediction models developed with administrative data can perform.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the models developed in this study showed promise, further research is needed to determine the performance limits of statistical and machine learning models that quantify suicide risk, and to develop prediction models optimized for implementation in clinical settings.",0.13467538905433152,other,"logistic regression, Logistic regression"

The ISO 1996-2 and ANSI S1.13 standards have described metrics to quantify the effects of prominent tones, but more research on how noise attributes effect annoyance and performance, especially in different levels of task difficulty are necessary. This paper investigates relations between noise metrics, annoyance responses and mental performance under different task difficulty levels while exposed to background noise with tonal components. In this study, sixty participants were evaluated on subjective perceived annoyance and varying workloads while exposed to 18 noise signals with three different prominence tones at three frequency tones and two background noise levels while doing three different levels of n-back tasks in a controlled test chamber. Performance parameters were measured by recording the reaction time, the correct rate, and the number of misses. The results indicate an increasing trend for number of misses and reaction times at higher task difficulty levels, but a decrease for correct rate. The study results showed a significant difference for subjective responses except for annoyance and loudness under different levels of task difficulty. The participants were more annoyed with higher background noise levels, lower tone frequencies and increasing tone levels especially under increasing task difficulty. Loudness metrics highly correlate with other noise metrics. Three models for the prediction of perceived annoyance are presented based on the most strongly correlated noise metrics using neural network models. Each of the three models had different input parameters and different network structures. The accuracy and MSE of all three neural network models show it to be appropriate for predicting perceived annoyance. The results show the effect of tonal noise on annoyance and mental performance especially in different levels of task difficulty. The results also suggest that neural network models have high accuracy and efficiency, and can be used to predict noise annoyance. Model 1 is preferred in certain aspects, such as lower input parameters, making it more user-friendly. The best neural network model included both loudness metrics and tonality metrics. It seems that combined metrics have the least importance and are unnecessary in the proposed neural network model.",0.12035486204417613,other,Unknown

This is particularly true when diseases have highly heterogeneous presentations and prognoses, as in chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL). Although machine learning methods can readily learn complex nonlinear relationships, many methods are criticized as inadequate because of limited interpretability. We propose using unsupervised clustering of the continuous output of machine learning models to provide discrete risk stratification for predicting time to first treatment in a cohort of patients with CLL.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 737 treatment-naïve patients with CLL diagnosed at Mayo Clinic were included in this study. We compared predictive abilities for two survival models (Cox proportional hazards and random survival forest) and four classification methods (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosting machine). Probability of treatment was then stratified.
RESULTS: Machine learning methods did not yield significantly more accurate predictions of time to first treatment. However, automated risk stratification provided by clustering was able to better differentiate patients who were at risk for treatment within 1 year than models developed using standard survival analysis techniques.
CONCLUSION: Clustering the posterior probabilities of machine learning models provides a way to better interpret machine learning models.",0.10343997304458032,other,"random forest, logistic regression"

Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models can capture the long-term trends and the periodic variations in time series. However, these models cannot handle the nonlinear trends correctly. Recurrent neural networks can address problems that involve nonlinear time series data. In this study, we intended to build prediction models for human brucellosis in mainland China with Elman and Jordan neural networks. The fitting and forecasting accuracy of the neural networks were compared with a traditional seasonal ARIMA model.
METHODS: The reported human brucellosis cases were obtained from the website of the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China. The human brucellosis cases from January 2004 to December 2017 were assembled as monthly counts. The training set observed from January 2004 to December 2016 was used to build the seasonal ARIMA model, Elman and Jordan neural networks. The test set from January 2017 to December 2017 was used to test the forecast results. The root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to assess the fitting and forecasting accuracy of the three models.
RESULTS: There were 52,868 cases of human brucellosis in Mainland China from January 2004 to December 2017. We observed a long-term upward trend and seasonal variance in the original time series. In the training set, the RMSE and MAE of Elman and Jordan neural networks were lower than those in the ARIMA model, whereas the MAPE of Elman and Jordan neural networks was slightly higher than that in the ARIMA model. In the test set, the RMSE, MAE and MAPE of Elman and Jordan neural networks were far lower than those in the ARIMA model.
CONCLUSIONS: The Elman and Jordan recurrent neural networks achieved much higher forecasting accuracy. These models are more suitable for forecasting nonlinear time series data, such as human brucellosis than the traditional ARIMA model.",0.10327071813379508,other,Unknown

Neurotropic virus-based trans-synaptic tracing tools have become an effective method for dissecting the structure and analyzing the function of neural-circuitry. However, these tracing systems rely on fluorescent signals, making it hard to visualize the panorama of the labeled networks in mammalian brain in vivo. One MRI method, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), is capable of imaging the networks of the whole brain in live animals but without information of anatomical connections through synapses. In this report, a chimeric gene coding for ferritin and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was integrated into Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a neurotropic virus that is able to spread anterogradely in synaptically connected networks. After the animal was injected with the recombinant VSV (rVSV), rVSV-Ferritin-EGFP, into the somatosensory cortex (SC) for four days, the labeled neural-network was visualized in the postmortem whole brain with a T2-weighted MRI sequence. The modified virus transmitted from SC to synaptically connected downstream regions. The results demonstrate that rVSV-Ferritin-EGFP could be used as a bimodal imaging vector for detecting synaptically connected neural-network with both ex vivo MRI and fluorescent imaging.

While these models can be used to answer many important research questions, their utility has been critically limited because the interpretation of the ""black box"" model is difficult. Clinical investigators usually employ ANN models to predict the clinical outcomes or to make a diagnosis; the model however is difficult to interpret for clinicians. To address this important shortcoming of neural network modeling methods, we describe several methods to help subject-matter audiences (e.g., clinicians, medical policy makers) understand neural network models. Garson's algorithm describes the relative magnitude of the importance of a descriptor (predictor) in its connection with outcome variables by dissecting the model weights. The Lek's profile method explores the relationship of the outcome variable and a predictor of interest, while holding other predictors at constant values (e.g., minimum, 20th quartile, maximum). While Lek's profile was developed specifically for neural networks, partial dependence plot is a more generic version that visualize the relationship between an outcome and one or two predictors. Finally, the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) method can show the predictions of any classification or regression, by approximating it locally with an interpretable model. R code for the implementations of these methods is shown by using example data fitted with a standard, feed-forward neural network model. We offer codes and step-by-step description on how to use these tools to facilitate better understanding of ANN.",0.19799908705970148,other,Unknown

A readily accessible means to continuously monitor for AF could prevent large numbers of strokes and death.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a deep neural network to detect AF using smartwatch data.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this multinational cardiovascular remote cohort study coordinated at the University of California, San Francisco, smartwatches were used to obtain heart rate and step count data for algorithm development. A total of 9750 participants enrolled in the Health eHeart Study and 51 patients undergoing cardioversion at the University of California, San Francisco, were enrolled between February 2016 and March 2017. A deep neural network was trained using a method called heuristic pretraining in which the network approximated representations of the R-R interval (ie, time between heartbeats) without manual labeling of training data. Validation was performed against the reference standard 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) in a separate cohort of patients undergoing cardioversion. A second exploratory validation was performed using smartwatch data from ambulatory individuals against the reference standard of self-reported history of persistent AF. Data were analyzed from March 2017 to September 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic C statistic for the algorithm to detect AF were generated based on the reference standard of 12-lead ECG-diagnosed AF.
RESULTS: Of the 9750 participants enrolled in the remote cohort, including 347 participants with AF, 6143 (63.0%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 42 (12) years. There were more than 139 million heart rate measurements on which the deep neural network was trained. The deep neural network exhibited a C statistic of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-1.00; P < .001) to detect AF against the reference standard 12-lead ECG-diagnosed AF in the external validation cohort of 51 patients undergoing cardioversion; sensitivity was 98.0% and specificity was 90.2%. In an exploratory analysis relying on self-report of persistent AF in ambulatory participants, the C statistic was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64-0.78); sensitivity was 67.7% and specificity was 67.6%.

The DeLong method was used to compare the models by fitting in sequential steps.
RESULTS: Variables found to be significant at a level of p<0.2 in a univariate logistic regression analysis (age, hypertension, waist circumference, body mass index [BMI], sedentary lifestyle, smoking, vegetable consumption, family history of T2DM, stress, walking, fruit consumption, and sex) were entered into the model.

Artificial neural networks (ANN) use small processors with a continuous network to solve problems inspired by the human brain. Bayesian neural networks (BNN) constitute a neural-based approach to modeling and non-linearization of complex issues using special algorithms and statistical methods. Gastric cancer incidence is the first and third ranking for men and women in Iran, respectively. The aim of the present study was to assess the value of an artificial neural network and a Bayesian neural network for modeling and predicting of probability of gastric cancer patient death. Materials and Methods: In this study, we used information on 339 patients aged from 20 to 90 years old with positive gastric cancer, referred to Afzalipoor and Shahid Bahonar Hospitals in Kerman City from 2001 to 2015. The three layers perceptron neural network (ANN) and the Bayesian neural network (BNN) were used for predicting the probability of mortality using the available data. To investigate differences between the models, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) were generated. Results: In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of the artificial neural network and Bayesian neural network models were 0.882, 0.903 and 0.954, 0.909, respectively. Prediction accuracy and the area under curve ROC for the two models were 0.891, 0.944 and 0.935, 0.961. The age at diagnosis of gastric cancer was most important for predicting survival, followed by tumor grade, morphology, gender, smoking history, opium consumption, receiving chemotherapy, presence of metastasis, tumor stage, receiving radiotherapy, and being resident in a village. Conclusion: The findings of the present study indicated that the Bayesian neural network is preferable to an artificial neural network for predicting survival of gastric cancer patients in Iran.",0.40549734870394194,other,Unknown

The proposed system possesses following distinctive properties: first, it is an integrated system which firstly detects and crops the Uyghur text lines using a single fully convolutional neural network, and then keywords in the lexicon are matched by a well-designed matching network. Second, to train the matching network effectively an online sampling method is applied, which generates synthetic data continually. Finally, we propose a GPU acceleration scheme for matching network to match a complete Uyghur text line directly rather than a single window. Experimental results on benchmark dataset show our method achieves a good performance of F-measure 74.5%. Besides, our system keeps high efficiency with 0.5s running time for each image due to the GPU acceleration scheme.",0.11067013327095793,computer vision,Unknown

Unlike other approaches that rely on timeseries analysis of historical ILI data and the state-of-the-art machine learning models, we build and evaluate the predictive power of neural network architectures based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) units capable of nowcasting (predicting in ""real-time"") and forecasting (predicting the future) ILI dynamics in the 2011 - 2014 influenza seasons. To build our models we integrate information people post in social media e.g., topics, embeddings, word ngrams, stylistic patterns, and communication behavior using hashtags and mentions. We then quantitatively evaluate the predictive power of different social media signals and contrast the performance of the-state-of-the-art regression models with neural networks using a diverse set of evaluation metrics. Finally, we combine ILI and social media signals to build a joint neural network model for ILI dynamics prediction. Unlike the majority of the existing work, we specifically focus on developing models for local rather than national ILI surveillance, specifically for military rather than general populations in 26 U.S. and six international locations., and analyze how model performance depends on the amount of social media data available per location. Our approach demonstrates several advantages: (a) Neural network architectures that rely on LSTM units trained on social media data yield the best performance compared to previously used regression models. (b) Previously under-explored language and communication behavior features are more predictive of ILI dynamics than stylistic and topic signals expressed in social media. (c) Neural network models learned exclusively from social media signals yield comparable or better performance to the models learned from ILI historical data, thus, signals from social media can be potentially used to accurately forecast ILI dynamics for the regions where ILI historical data is not available. (d) Neural network models learned from combined ILI and social media signals significantly outperform models that rely solely on ILI historical data, which adds to a great potential of alternative public sources for ILI dynamics prediction. (e) Location-specific models outperform previously used location-independent models e.g., U.S. only. (f) Prediction results significantly vary across geolocations depending on the amount of social media data available and ILI activity patterns. (g) Model performance improves with more tweets available per geo-location e.g., the error gets lower and the Pearson score gets higher for locations with more tweets.",0.12878321193236572,other,LSTM

This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of artificial intelligence models for 5-year overall survival prediction in patients with cervical cancer treated by radical hysterectomy.
METHODS: The data set was collected from 102 patients with cervical cancer FIGO stage IA2-IIB, that underwent primary surgical treatment. Twenty-three demographic, tumor-related parameters and selected perioperative data of each patient were collected. The simulations involved six computational intelligence methods: the probabilistic neural network (PNN), multilayer perceptron network, gene expression programming classifier, support vector machines algorithm, radial basis function neural network and k-Means algorithm. The prediction ability of the models was determined based on the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, as well as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results of the computational intelligence methods were compared with the results of linear regression analysis as a reference model.
RESULTS: The best results were obtained by the PNN model. This neural network provided very high prediction ability with an accuracy of 0.892 and sensitivity of 0.975. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of PNN was also high, 0.818. The outcomes obtained by other classifiers were markedly worse.

METHODS: A total of 92 workers with LBP as the case group and 68 healthy workers as a control group were selected in various industrial units with similar occupational conditions. The demographic information and personal, occupational, and psychosocial factors of the participants were collected via interview, related questionnaires, consultation with occupational medicine, and also the Rapid Entire Body Assessment worksheet and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index software. Then, 16 risk factors for LBP were used as input variables to develop the prediction model. Networks with various multilayered structures were developed using MATLAB.
RESULTS: The developed neural networks with 1 hidden layer and 26 neurons had the least error of classification in both training and testing phases. The mean of classification accuracy of the developed neural networks for the testing and training phase data were about 88% and 96%, respectively. In addition, the mean of classification accuracy of both training and testing data was 92%, indicating much better results compared with other methods.

It is important to assess patients after RFA. The goal of this study was to build artificial neural network models with HCC-related variables to predict the 1-year and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) of HCC patients receiving RFA treatments.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective study that tracked HCC patients who received computer tomography-guided percutaneous RFA between January 2009 and April 2012. The numbers of total patients with 1-year and 2-year DFS were 252 and 179, respectively. A total of 15 HCC clinical variables were collected for the construction of artificial neural network models for DFS prediction. Internal validation and validation conducted using simulated prospective data were performed.
RESULTS: The results showed that the model with 15 inputs showed better performance compared with the models including only significant features. Parameters for performance assessment of 1-year DFS prediction were as follows: accuracy 85.0% (70.0%), sensitivity 75.0% (63.3%), specificity 87.5% (71.8%), and area under the curve 0.84 (0.77) for internal validation (simulated prospective validation).

Predicting the risk of foetal outcome is essential for maximizing the success of pregnancy. This study aimed to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to predict pregnancy outcomes among SLE-affected pregnant women.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 149 pregnant women with SLE, who were followed at Shariati Hospital (104 pregnancies) and a specialized clinic (45 pregnancies) from 1982 to 2014. We selected significant features (p<0.10) using a binary logistic regression model performed in IBM SPSS (version 20). Afterward, we trained several artificial neural networks (multi-layer perceptron [MLP] and radial basis function [RBF]) to predict the pregnancy outcome. In order to evaluate and select the most effective network, we used the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We finally developed a CDSS based on the most accurate network. MATLAB 2013b software was applied to design the neural networks and develop the CDSS.
RESULTS: Initially, 45 potential variables were analysed by the binary logistic regression and 16 effective features were selected as the inputs of neural networks (P-value<0.1). The accuracy (90.9%), sensitivity (80.0%), and specificity (94.1%) of the test data for the MLP network were achieved. These measures for the RBF network were 71.4%, 53.3%, and 79.4%, respectively. Having applied a 10-fold cross-validation method, the accuracy for the networks showed 75.16% accuracy for RBF and 90.6% accuracy for MLP. Therefore, the MLP network was selected as the most accurate network for prediction of pregnancy outcome.

Existing prediction models have a high false positive rate, leading to multiple false alarms and alarm fatigue. We used routine vital signs and laboratory values obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR) along with a machine learning algorithm called a neural network to develop a prediction model that would increase the predictive accuracy and decrease false alarm rates.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: The hematologic malignancy unit in an academic medical center in the United States.
PATIENT POPULATION: Adult patients admitted to the hematologic malignancy unit from 2009 to 2010.
INTERVENTION: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Vital signs and laboratory values were obtained from the electronic medical record system and then used as predictors (features). A neural network was used to build a model to predict clinical deterioration events (ICU transfer and cardiac arrest). The performance of the neural network model was compared to the VitalPac Early Warning Score (ViEWS). Five hundred sixty five consecutive total admissions were available with 43 admissions resulting in clinical deterioration. Using simulation, the neural network outperformed the ViEWS model with a positive predictive value of 82% compared to 24%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We developed and tested a neural network-based prediction model for clinical deterioration in patients hospitalized in the hematologic malignancy unit. Our neural network model outperformed an existing model, substantially increasing the positive predictive value, allowing the clinician to be confident in the alarm raised. This system can be readily implemented in a real-time fashion in existing EMR systems.",0.24414901285285168,other,Unknown

Like a ball rolling down a hillside is channelled through a succession of valleys until it reaches the bottom, cells follow specific trajectories from a pluripotent state to a committed state. Transcription factors (TFs) interacting as a network (the gene regulatory network (GRN)) orchestrate this developmental process within each cell. Here, we quantitatively model the epigenetic landscape using a kind of artificial neural network called the Hopfield network (HN). An HN is composed of nodes (genes/TFs) and weighted undirected edges, resulting in a weight matrix (W) that stores interactions among the nodes over the entire network. We used gene co-expression to compute the edge weights. Through W, we then associate an energy score (E) to each input pattern (pattern of co-expression for a specific developmental stage) such that each pattern has a specific E. We propose that, based on the co-expression values stored in W, HN associates lower E values to stable phenotypic states and higher E to transient states. We validate our model using time course gene-expression data sets representing stages of development across 12 biological processes including differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into specialized cells, differentiation of THP1 monocytes to macrophages during immune response and trans-differentiation of epithelial to mesenchymal cells in cancer. We observe that transient states have higher energy than the stable phenotypic states, yielding an arc-shaped trajectory. This relationship was confirmed by perturbation analysis. HNs offer an attractive framework for quantitative modelling of cell differentiation (as a landscape) from empirical data. Using HNs, we identify genes and TFs that drive cell-fate transitions, and gain insight into the global dynamics of GRNs.",0.10403426885091639,other,Unknown

The aim of this study was to develop classifiers for predicting resistance to the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir using a probabilistic neural network (PNN). The data were provided by the Molecular Virology Laboratory of the Health Sciences Center, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (CCS-UFRJ/Brazil). Using bootstrap and stepwise techniques, ten features were selected by logistic regression (LR) to be used as inputs to the network. Bootstrap and cross-validation were used to define the smoothing parameter of the PNN networks. Four balanced models were designed and evaluated using a separate test set. The accuracies of the classifiers with the test set ranged from 0.89 to 0.94, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) ranged from 0.96 to 0.97. The sensitivity ranged from 0.94 to 1.00, and the specificity was between 0.88 and 0.92. Four classifiers showed performances very close to three existing expert-based interpretation systems, the HIVdb, the Rega and the ANRS algorithms, and to a k-Nearest Neighbor.",0.11158368947099671,other,logistic regression

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 696 patients with lung cancer were enrolled. The factors were compared employing Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney test or the Chi-square test and variables that were significantly related to the presence of deep fungal infection selected as candidates for input into the final artificial neural network analysis (ANN) model. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) model and logistic regression (LR) model.
RESULTS: The prevalence of deep fungal infection from lung cancer in this entire study population was 32.04%(223/696), deep fungal infections occur in sputum specimens 44.05% (200/454). The ratio of candida albicans was 86.99% (194/223) in the total fungi. It was demonstrated that older (≥65 years), use of antibiotics, low serum albumin concentrations (≤37.18 g /L), radiotherapy, surgery, low hemoglobin hyperlipidemia (≤93.67 g /L), long time of hospitalization (≥14 days) were apt to deep fungal infection and the ANN model consisted of the seven factors. The AUC of ANN model (0.829±0.019) was higher than that of LR model (0.756±0.021).

METHODS: This study was conducted in three phases: data preparation, training phase, and testing phase. A sample from a database consisting of 23 million pharmacy insurance claim records, from 2004 to 2011 was used, in which a total of 330 prescriptions were assessed and used to train and test the models simultaneously. In the training phase, the selected prescriptions were assessed by both a physician and a pharmacist separately and assigned a diagnosis. To test the performance of each model, a k-fold stratified cross validation was conducted in addition to measuring their sensitivity and specificity.
RESULT: Generally, two methods had very similar accuracies. Considering the weighted average of true positive rate (sensitivity) and true negative rate (specificity), the decision tree had slightly higher accuracy in its ability for correct classification (83.3% and 96% versus 80.3% and 95.1%, respectively).

However, inappropriate or poorly optimized processing and modeling of miRNA expression data can negatively affect prediction performance. Here, we propose a holistic solution for miRNA biomarker selection and prediction model building. This work introduces the use of a neural network cascade, a cascaded constitution of small artificial neural network units, for evaluating miRNA expression and patient outcome. A miRNA microarray dataset of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus to illustrate the methodology. Results indicated a nonlinear relationship between miRNA expression and patient death risk, implying that direct comparison of expression values is inappropriate. However, this method performs transformation of miRNA expression values into a miRNA score, which linearly measures death risk. Spearman correlation was calculated between miRNA scores and survival status for each miRNA. Finally, a nine-miRNA signature was optimized to predict death risk after nasopharyngeal carcinoma by establishing a neural network cascade consisting of 13 artificial neural network units. Area under the ROC was 0.951 for the internal validation set and had a prediction accuracy of 83% for the external validation set. In particular, the established neural network cascade was found to have strong immunity against noise interference that disturbs miRNA expression values. This study provides an efficient and easy-to-use method that aims to maximize clinical application of miRNAs in prognostic risk assessment of patients with cancer.",0.15949990346007187,other,Unknown

The target of proposed technique is to determine which patients have high chance to re-intervention (high-risk patients) and which are not (low-risk patients) after 5 years of the surgery. Two censored datasets relating to the clinical conditions of aortic aneurysms have been collected from two different vascular centers in the United Kingdom. A Bayesian network was first employed to solve the censoring issue in the datasets. Then, a back propagation neural network model was built using the uncensored data of the first center to predict re-intervention on the second center and classify the patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted for each group of patients separately to show whether there is a significant difference between the two risk groups. Finally, the logrank test was applied to determine whether the neural network model was capable of predicting and distinguishing between the two risk groups. The results show that the Bayesian network used for uncensoring the data has improved the performance of the neural networks that were built for the two centers separately. More importantly, the neural network that was trained with uncensored data of the first center was able to predict and discriminate between groups of low risk and high risk of re-intervention after 5 years of endovascular aortic aneurysm surgery at center 2 (p = 0.0037 in the logrank test).",0.25713217783707326,other,Unknown

A recent systemic review estimates global prevalence of AF to be 596.2 and 373.1 per 100,000 population in males and females respectively. Multiple mechanisms have been put forward in the pathogenesis of AF, however; multiple wavelet hypothesis is the most accepted theory so far. Similar to the conduction system of the heart, a neural network exists which surrounds the heart and plays an important role in formation of the substrate of AF and when a trigger is originated, usually from pulmonary vein sleeves, AF occurs. This neural network includes ganglionated plexi (GP) located adjacent to pulmonary vein ostia which are under control of higher centers in normal people. When these GP become hyperactive owing to loss of inhibition from higher centers e.g. in elderly, AF can occur. We can control these hyperactive GP either by stimulating higher centers and their connections, e.g. vagus nerve stimulation or simply by ablating these GP. This review provides detailed information about the different proposed mechanisms underlying AF, the exact role of autonomic neural tone in the pathogenesis of AF and the possible role of neural modulation in the treatment of AF.",0.10872521855307914,other,Unknown

METHODS: Data regarding both the incidence of infectious diarrhea from 2005 to 2008 in Shanghai and meteorological factors including temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, duration of sunshine and wind speed within the same periods were collected and analyzed with the MatLab R2012b software. Meteorological factors that were correlated with infectious diarrhea were screened by Spearman correlation analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to remove the multi-colinearities between meteorological factors. Back-Propagation (BP) neural network was employed to establish related prediction models regarding the daily infectious diarrhea incidence, using artificial neural networks toolbox. The established models were evaluated through the fitting, predicting and forecasting processes.
RESULTS: Data from Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the incidence of infectious diarrhea had a highly positive correlation with factors as daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, minimum relative humidity and average relative humidity in the previous two days (P < 0.01), and a relatively high negative correlation with the daily average air pressure in the previous two days (P < 0.01). Factors as mean absolute error, root mean square error, correlation coefficient(r), and the coefficient of determination (r(2)) of BP neural network model were established under the input of 4 meteorological principal components, extracted by PCA and used for training and prediction.

This data includes the information of low back pain and its associated risk factors among Iranian people aged 15 years and older. Artificial neural network and logistic regression models were developed using a set of 17294 data and they were validated in a test set of 17295 data. Hosmer and Lemeshow recommendation for model selection was used in fitting the logistic regression. A three-layer perceptron with 9 inputs, 3 hidden and 1 output neurons was employed. The efficiency of two models was compared by receiver operating characteristic analysis, root mean square and -2 Loglikelihood criteria.
RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the logistic regression was 0.752 (0.004), 0.3832 and 14769.2, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the artificial neural network was 0.754 (0.004), 0.3770 and 14757.6, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these three criteria, artificial neural network would give better performance than logistic regression. Although, the difference is statistically significant, it does not seem to be clinically significant.",0.2057811354899834,other,logistic regression

Diabetes disease diagnosis via proper interpretation of the diabetes data is an important problem in neural networks. Unfortunately, although several classification studies have been carried out with significant performance, many of the current methods often fail to reach out to patients. Graphical user interface-enabled tools need to be developed through which medical practitioners can simply enter the health profiles of their patients and receive an instant diabetes prediction with an acceptable degree of confidence.
METHODS: In this study, the neural network approach was used for a dataset of 768 persons from a Pima Indian population living near Phoenix, AZ. A neural network mixture of experts model was trained with these data using the expectation-minimization algorithm.
RESULTS: The mixture of experts method was used to train the algorithm with 97% accuracy. A graphical user interface was developed that would work in conjunction with the trained network to provide the output in a presentable format.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a machine-implementable approach that can be used by physicians and patients to minimize the extent of error in diagnosis. The authors are hopeful that replication of results of this study in other populations may lead to improved diagnosis. Physicians can simply enter the health profile of patients and get the diagnosis for diabetes type 2.",0.1554694674557482,other,Unknown

As patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to lupus nephropathy are generally younger than the typical ESRD patients and also seem to have inferior transplant outcome, developing an outcome prediction model in this patient category has high clinical relevance. The goal of this study was to compare methods of building prediction models of kidney transplant outcome that potentially can be useful for clinical decision support. We applied three well-known data mining methods (classification trees, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks) to the data describing recipients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the US Renal Data System (USRDS) database. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUC) was used to measure the discrimination ability of the prediction models. Two groups of predictors were selected to build the prediction models. Using input variables based on Weka (a open source machine learning software) supplemented with additional variables of known clinical relevance (38 total predictors), the logistic regression performed the best overall (AUC: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.72-0.77)-significantly better (p < 0.05) than the classification trees (AUC: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.67-0.72) but not significantly better (p = 0.218) than the artificial neural networks (AUC: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.69-0.73). The performance of the artificial neural networks was not significantly better than that of the classification trees (p = 0.693). Using the more parsimonious subset of variables (six variables), the logistic regression (AUC: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.71-0.75) did not perform significantly better than either the classification tree (AUC: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.68-0.73) or the artificial neural network (AUC: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.70-0.75) models. We generated several models predicting 3-year allograft survival in kidney transplant recipients with SLE that potentially can be used in practice.

The mortality prognosis based on 4 scores that are often used is compared with the prognosis of a trained neural network. We built an alarm system using the network classification results. Method. We analyzed the data of 382 patients with abdominal septic shock who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from 1998 to 2002. The analysis includes the calculation of daily sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA), Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II, multiple-organ dysfunction score (MODS) scores for each patient and the training and testing of an appropriate neural network. Results. For our patients with abdominal septic shock, the analysis shows that it is not possible to predict their individual fate correctly on the day of admission to the ICU on the basis of any current score. However, when the trained network computes a score value below the threshold during the ICU stay, there is a high probability that the patient will die within 3 days. The trained neural network obtains the same outcome prediction performance as the best score, the SOFA score, using narrower confidence intervals and considering three variables only: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and the number of thrombocytes. We conclude that the currently best available score for abdominal septic shock may be replaced by the output of a trained neural network with only 3 input variables.",0.21672528671690827,other,Unknown

The City of Cantá, State of Roraima, presented one of the largest annual parasite indices in Brazil for the entire study period, with a value always greater than 50. The present study aimed to use an artificial neural network to predict the incidence of malaria in this city in order to assist health coordinators in planning and managing resources.
METHODS: Data were collected on the website of the Ministry of Health, SIVEP--Malaria between 2003 and 2009. An artificial neural network was structured with three neurons in the input layer, two intermediate layers and an output layer with one neuron. A sigmoid activation function was used. In training, the backpropagation method was used, with a learning rate of 0.05 and momentum of 0.01. The stopping criterion was to reach 20,000 cycles or a target of 0.001. The data from 2003 to 2008 were used for training and validation. The results were compared with those from a logistic regression model.
RESULTS: The results for all periods provided showed that the artificial neural network had a smaller mean square error and absolute error compared with the regression model for the year 2009.

METHODS: This study was a historical cohort study with data gathered from 436 registered gastric cancer patients who underwent surgery between 2002 and 2007 at the Taleghani Hospital (a referral center for gastrointestinal cancers), Tehran, Iran. In order to determine risk factors and their importance, neural network and Weibull regression models were used.
RESULTS: The Weibull regression analysis showed that lymph node metastasis and histopathology of tumor were selected as important variables. Based on the neural network model, staging, lymph node metastasis, histopathology of tumor, metastasis, and age at diagnosis were selected as important variables. The true prediction of neural network was 82.6%, and for the Weibull regression model, 75.7%.

Records were obtained from patients beginning dialysis in 1990 through 2007. We developed linear and neural network models and optimized the fit of these models to the actual time to death. Next, we examined whether we could accurately predict survival in a dataset containing censored and uncensored patients. The results with these models were contrasted with those obtained with a Cox proportional hazards model fit to the entire dataset. The average C statistic over a 6-month to 10-year time range achieved with these models was approximately 0.7891 (linear model), 0.7804 (transformed dataset linear model), 0.7769 (neural network model), 0.7774 (transformed dataset neural network model), 0.8019 (Cox model), and 0.7970 (transformed dataset Cox model).

A secondary objective was to explore if it was possible to identify CAD patients at a high cardiovascular risk due to metabolic perturbations. The 1,867 patients with CAD were gluco-metabolically classified by an OGTT. Among these, 990 patients had complete data regarding all components of the metabolic syndrome, BMI, HbA1c and medical history. Only FPG and HDL-c adjusting for age significantly impacted OGTT classification. Based on these variables, a neural network reached a cross-validated misclassification rate of 37.8% compared with OGTT. By this criterion, 1,283 patients with complete one-year follow-up concerning all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke (CVE) were divided into low- and high-risk groups within which CVE were, respectively, 5.1 and 9.4% (p=0.016).Adjusting for confounding variables the relative risk for a CVE based on the neural network was 2.06 (95% CI: 1.18-3.58) compared with 1.37 (95% CI: 0.79-2.36) for OGTT.

The patients were grouped according to geographical distribution, which also parallels CHD mortality risk. Logistic model solutions were estimated for each geographic area. Training neural network models were estimated in one high risk (US) and one low risk (Italy) population and each was rerun in each nonindex population.
RESULTS: CHD mortality prediction by training MLP neural network or multiple logistic function had similar (0.669-0.699) receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC).

Three hundred thirty gastric cancer patients admitted to and surgically treated were assessed and their post-surgical survival was determined. The observed baseline survival was determined with the three methods of Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator, Cox and the neural network and results were compared. Then the binary independent variables were entered into the model. Data were randomly divided into two groups of 165 each to test the models and assess the reproducibility. The Chi-square test and the multiple logistic model were used to ensure the groups were similar and the data was divided randomly. To compare subgroups, we used the log-rank test. In the next step, the probability of survival in different periods was computed based on the training group data using the Cox proportional hazards and a neural network and estimating Cox coefficient values and neural network weights (with 3 nodes in hidden layer). Results were used for predictions in the test group data and these predictions were compared using the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator as the gold standard. Friedman and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparisons as well. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.5, Matlab version 7.2, Statistica version 6.0 and S_PLUS 2000. The significance level was considered 5% (alpha = 0.05). The three methods used showed no significance difference in base survival probabilities. Overall, there was no significant difference among the survival probabilities or the trend of changes in survival probabilities calculated with the three methods, but the 4 year (48th month) and 4.5 year (54th month) survival rates were significantly different with Cox compared to standard and estimated probabilities in the neural network (p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier and Cox showed almost similar results for the baseline survival probabilities, but results with the neural network were different: higher probabilities up to the 4th year, then comparable with the other two methods. Estimates from Cox proportional hazards and the neural network with three nodes in hidden layer were compared with the estimate from the Kaplan-Meier estimator as the gold standard. Neither comparison showed statistically significant differences. The standard error ratio of the two estimate groups by Cox and the neural network to Kaplan-Meier were no significant differences, it indicated that the neural network was more accurate. Although we do not suggest neural network methods to estimate the baseline survival probability, it seems these models is more accurately estimated as compared with the Cox proportional hazards, especially with today's advanced computer sciences that allow complex calculations. These methods are preferable because they lack the limitations of conventional models and obviate the need for unnecessary assumptions including those related to the proportionality of hazards and linearity.",0.26900464809100266,other,Unknown

In addition to precipitation, other meteorological and environmental factors may also influence malaria transmission. These factors can be remotely sensed using earth observing environmental satellites and estimated with seasonal climate forecasts. The use of remote sensing usage as an early warning tool for malaria epidemics have been broadly studied in recent years, especially for Africa, where the majority of the world's malaria occurs. Although the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), which includes Thailand and the surrounding countries, is an epicenter of multidrug resistant falciparum malaria, the meteorological and environmental factors affecting malaria transmissions in the GMS have not been examined in detail. In this study, the parasitological data used consisted of the monthly malaria epidemiology data at the provincial level compiled by the Thai Ministry of Public Health. Precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, and vegetation index obtained from both climate time series and satellite measurements were used as independent variables to model malaria. We used neural network methods, an artificial-intelligence technique, to model the dependency of malaria transmission on these variables. The average training accuracy of the neural network analysis for three provinces (Kanchanaburi, Mae Hong Son, and Tak) which are among the provinces most endemic for malaria, is 72.8% and the average testing accuracy is 62.9% based on the 1994-1999 data. A more complex neural network architecture resulted in higher training accuracy but also lower testing accuracy. Taking into account of the uncertainty regarding reported malaria cases, we divided the malaria cases into bands (classes) to compute training accuracy. Using the same neural network architecture on the 19 most endemic provinces for years 1994 to 2000, the mean training accuracy weighted by provincial malaria cases was 73%. Prediction of malaria cases for 2001 using neural networks trained for 1994-2000 gave a weighted accuracy of 53%. Because there was a significant decrease (31%) in the number of malaria cases in the 19 provinces from 2000 to 2001, the networks overestimated malaria transmissions. The decrease in transmission was not due to climatic or environmental changes. Thailand is a country with long borders. Migrant populations from the neighboring countries enlarge the human malaria reservoir because these populations have more limited access to health care. This issue also confounds the complexity of modeling malaria based on meteorological and environmental variables alone. In spite of the relatively low resolution of the data and the impact of migrant populations, we have uncovered a reasonably clear dependency of malaria on meteorological and environmental remote sensing variables. When other contextual determinants do not vary significantly, using neural network analysis along with remote sensing variables to predict malaria endemicity should be feasible.",0.11191545427212701,other,Unknown

The latter requires clinically trained personnel at the reception site to triage patients. Current methodology based on Revised Trauma Score (tRTS) requires use of Glasgow Coma Scale, a method reliant on experience and clinical knowledge. This makes the system subjective and often inadequate for non-clinicians. This project attempts to develop a simplified outcome prediction score using an artificial neural network for use by a non-clinically trained EMS to aid triage. The project uses National Trauma Data Bank, Version 6.1. Tiberius Data Mining Software created Neural Network models. Variables considered were values that could easily be obtained during an event. Binary values were used for low SBP and low Respiratory Rate, coded using the RTS scoring table as a basis, and age indicators. A modified motor component of Glasgow Coma Score was created to negate the need for clinical knowledge. Best performing models, identified by Gini coefficient and ability to predict mortality, were with 8 and 10 neurons. On mortality prediction all even numbers of hidden neurons have similar performances. Training sets were compared to test sets, and found to be identical in Gini coefficient and performance. Models performed well in predicting mortality compared to standard outcome predictors. Possible additional variables such as gender or ethnicity might improve the Neural Network predictive ability.

The forecasting model is constructed under data from hepatitis B monthly incidence rate reports from 1991-2002. After learning and training on the basic concepts of the network, simulation experiments are completed, and then the incidence rates from Jan. 2003-Jun. 2003 forecasted by the established model.

A better understanding of the risk factors is of great help in developing effective new technologies and appropriate prevention strategies for WNV infection. A contribution analysis of all risk factors in WNV infection would identify those major risk factors. Based on the identified major risk factors, measures to control WNV proliferation could be directed toward those significant risk factors, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency in developing WNV control and prevention strategies. Neural networks have many generally accepted advantages over conventional analytical techniques, for instance, ability to automatically learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs from training data, powerful generalization ability, and capability of handling nonlinear interactions. In this article, a neural network model was developed for analysis of risk factors in WNV infection. To reveal the relative contribution of the input variables, the neural network was trained using an algorithm called structural learning with forgetting. During the learning, weak neural connections are forced to fade away while a skeletal network with strong connections emerges. The significant risk factors can be identified by analyzing this skeletal network. The proposed approach is tested with the dead bird surveillance data in Ontario, Canada. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",0.16368348468243826,other,Unknown

There are three stages to the process, namely time-to-event modelling, risk stratification by predicted outcome and model interpretation using rule extraction. Model selection was carried out using the benchmark linear model, Cox regression but risk staging was derived with Cox regression and with Partial Logistic Regression Artificial Neural Networks regularised with Automatic Relevance Determination (PLANN-ARD). This analysis compares the two approaches showing the benefit of using the neural network framework especially for patients at high risk. The neural network model also has results in a smooth model of the hazard without the need for limiting assumptions of proportionality. The model predictions were verified using out-of-sample testing with the mortality model also compared with two other prognostic models called TNG and the NPI rule model. Further verification was carried out by comparing marginal estimates of the predicted and actual cumulative hazards. It was also observed that doctors seem to treat mortality and disease-free models as equivalent, so a further analysis was performed to observe if this was the case. The analysis was extended with automatic rule generation using Orthogonal Search Rule Extraction (OSRE). This methodology translates analytical risk scores into the language of the clinical domain, enabling direct validation of the operation of the Cox or neural network model.

The combined impact of even small amounts of missing data on a multi-SNP analysis may be considerable. In this study, we present a neural network method for imputing missing SNP genotype data. We compared its imputation accuracy with fastPHASE and an expectation-maximization algorithm implemented in HelixTree. In a simulation data set of 1000 SNPs and 1000 subjects, 1, 5 and 10% of genotypes were randomly masked. Four levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD), LD R2<0.2, R2<0.5, R2<0.8 and no LD threshold, were examined to evaluate the impact of LD on imputation accuracy. All three methods are capable of imputing most missing genotypes accurately (accuracy >86%). The neural network method accurately predicted 92.0-95.9% of the missing genotypes. In a real data set comparison with 419 subjects and 126 SNPs from chromosome 2, the neural network method achieves the highest imputation accuracies >83.1% with missing rate from 1 to 5%. Using 90 HapMap subjects with 1962 SNPs, fastPHASE had the highest accuracy ( approximately 97%) while the other two methods had >95% accuracy.

Recently, a model for predicting significant fibrosis (bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis) on the basis of logistic regression and routine laboratory data has been proposed (logit model). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of an artificial neural network, a technique reported to work better than logit models in complex biological situations, built on those same clinical variables and data set of patients, in predicting significant fibrosis.
METHODS: The neural network was constructed on the training set of 414 protocol biopsies, from liver transplant recipients, and then tested on the remaining 96 biopsies, as validation set. Model performances of neural network and logit model were evaluated and compared by means of areas under receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: With a cutoff value of >0.4 to predict significant fibrosis, the neural network provided sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, respectively, of 100, 79.5, 60.5 and 100%, in the validation set. The performance of the neural network was significantly better than that of the logit model (in the validation set area under the curve = 0.93 vs. 0.84; P = 0.045).

This study aimed to develop a method to select risk variables and predict mortality after cardiac surgery by using artificial neural networks.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data from 18,362 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at 128 European institutions in 1995 (the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation database) were used. Models to predict the operative mortality were constructed using artificial neural networks. For calibration a sixfold cross-validation technique was used, and for testing a fourfold cross-testing was performed. Risk variables were ranked and minimized in number by calibrated artificial neural networks. Mortality prediction with 95% confidence limits for each patient was obtained by the bootstrap technique. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was used as a quantitative measure of the ability to distinguish between survivors and nonsurvivors. Subgroup analysis of surgical operation categories was performed. The results were compared with those from logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation analysis.
RESULTS: The operative mortality was 4.9%. Artificial neural networks selected 34 of the total 72 risk variables as relevant for mortality prediction. The receiver operating characteristics area for artificial neural networks (0.81) was larger than the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation model (0.79; P = .0001). For different surgical operation categories, there were no differences in the discriminatory power for the artificial neural networks (P = .15) but significant differences were found for the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (P = .0072).
CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors in a ranked order contributing to the mortality prediction were identified. A minimal set of risk variables achieving a superior mortality prediction was defined. The artificial neural network model is applicable independent of the cardiac surgical procedure.",0.18043554557546343,other,Unknown

This is why selecting a classifier from a constrained family of classifiers, ones that do not possess the potential to too finely partition the feature space, is typically preferable. But overfitting is not merely a consequence of the classifier family; it is highly dependent on the classification rule used to design a classifier from the sample data. Thus, it is possible to consider families that are rather complex but for which there are classification rules that perform well for small samples. Such classification rules can be advantageous because they facilitate satisfactory classification when the class-conditional distributions are not easily separated and the sample is not large. Here we consider neural networks, from the perspectives of classical design based solely on the sample data and from noise-injection-based design.
RESULTS: This paper provides an extensive simulation-based comparative study of noise-injected neural-network design. It considers a number of different feature-label models across various small sample sizes using varying amounts of noise injection. Besides comparing noise-injected neural-network design to classical neural-network design, the paper compares it to a number of other classification rules. Our particular interest is with the use of microarray data for expression-based classification for diagnosis and prognosis. To that end, we consider noise-injected neural-network design as it relates to a study of survivability of breast cancer patients.
CONCLUSION: The conclusion is that in many instances noise-injected neural network design is superior to the other tested methods, and in almost all cases it does not perform substantially worse than the best of the other methods. Since the amount of noise injected is consequential, the effect of differing amounts of injected noise must be considered.",0.18573055772025135,other,Unknown

Epub 2005 Feb 17.,Jaimes F,Crit Care,2005,2005/03/19,PMC1175932,,10.1186/cc3054,"INTRODUCTION: Neural networks are new methodological tools based on nonlinear models. They appear to be better at prediction and classification in biological systems than do traditional strategies such as logistic regression. This paper provides a practical example that contrasts both approaches within the setting of suspected sepsis in the emergency room.
METHODS: The study population comprised patients with suspected bacterial infection as their main diagnosis for admission to the emergency room at two University-based hospitals. Mortality within the first 28 days from admission was predicted using logistic regression with the following variables: age, immunosuppressive systemic disease, general systemic disease, Shock Index, temperature, respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, leucocyte counts, platelet counts and creatinine. Also, with the same input and output variables, a probabilistic neural network was trained with an adaptive genetic algorithm. The network had three neurone layers: 10 neurones in the input layer, 368 in the hidden layer and two in the output layer. Calibration was measured using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and discrimination was determined using receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: A total of 533 patients were recruited and overall 28-day mortality was 19%. The factors chosen by logistic regression (with their score in parentheses) were as follows: immunosuppressive systemic disease or general systemic disease (2), respiratory rate 24-33 breaths/min (1), respiratory rate > or = 34 breaths/min (3), Glasgow Come Scale score < or = 12 (3), Shock Index > or = 1.5 (2) and temperature < 38 degrees C (2). The network included all variables and there were no significant differences in predictive ability between the approaches. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.7517 and 0.8782 for the logistic model and the neural network, respectively (P = 0.037).
CONCLUSION: A predictive model would be an extremely useful tool in the setting of suspected sepsis in the emergency room. It could serve both as a guideline in medical decision-making and as a simple way to select or stratify patients in clinical research. Our proposed model and the specific development method -- either logistic regression or neural networks -- must be evaluated and validated in an independent population.",0.1535470755342017,other,logistic regression

Both these methods have advantages and disadvantages. In this study we have compared the performance of artificial neural network and multivariable logistic regression models, in prediction of outcomes in head trauma and studied the reproducibility of the findings.
METHODS: 1000 Logistic regression and ANN models based on initial clinical data related to the GCS, tracheal intubation status, age, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, injury severity score and the outcome of 1271 mainly head injured patients were compared in this study. For each of one thousand pairs of ANN and logistic models, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) statistics and accuracy rate were calculated and compared using paired T-tests.
RESULTS: ANN significantly outperformed logistic models in both fields of discrimination and calibration but under performed in accuracy. In 77.8% of cases the area under the ROC curves and in 56.4% of cases the HL statistics for the neural network model were superior to that for the logistic model. In 68% of cases the accuracy of the logistic model was superior to the neural network model.
CONCLUSIONS: ANN significantly outperformed the logistic models in both fields of discrimination and calibration but lagged behind in accuracy. This study clearly showed that any single comparison between these two models might not reliably represent the true end results. External validation of the designed models, using larger databases with different rates of outcomes is necessary to get an accurate measure of performance outside the development population.",0.19072526521471517,other,"logistic regression, Logistic regression"

We studied 453 patients with a thyroid nodule diagnosed as indeterminate at FNAB by using a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) analysis to integrate cytologic and clinical data, with the goal of subgrouping patients into a high-risk and in a low-risk category. Three hundred seventy-one patients were used to train the network and 82 patients were used to validate the model. The cytologic smears were blindly reviewed and classified in a high-risk and a low-risk subgroup on the basis of standard criteria. Neural network analysis subdivided the 371 lesions of the first series into a high-risk group (cancer rate of approximately 33% at histology) and a low-risk group (cancer rate of 3%). Only cytologic parameters contributed to this classification. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated that the ANN model discriminated with higher sensitivity and specificity between benign and malignant nodules compared to standard cytologic criteria (p < 0.001). This value did not show degradation when ANN predictions were applied to the validation series of 82 nodules. In conclusion, neural network analysis of cytologic data may be a useful tool to refine the risk of cancer in patients with lesions diagnosed as indeterminate by FNAB.",0.14910794596514715,other,Unknown

METHODS: With back-propagation neural network (BP network) as fitting model based upon data gathered from an epidemiological survey on diabetes mellitus and under the network structure of 22-6-1, the mean impact value (MIV) for each input variables and sequencing the factors according to their absolute MIVs were calculated. The results from BP network with multiple logistic regression analysis and log-linear model for united actions between factors were compared with optimizing Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
RESULTS: By BP network analysis, the sequence of importance for the risk factors of diabetes mellitus became: faster pulse, diabetes mellitus family history, living longer in the investigated area, with medical record of nephropathy, having higher ratio for waist-to-hip, being male, with medical records of diseases as hyperlipoproteinmia, coronary heart disease, hypertension, high diastolic pressure, higher income, do no drink alcohol, age, higher systolic pressure, less educated, body mass index, with medical records of other diseases, physical exercise related to jobs smoking, occupation, with medical record for cerebrovascular disease, with medical record for liver disease etc. However, only 7 factors were statistically significant in multiple logistic regression analysis. The sequence of their importance appeared as: pulse, diabetes mellitus family history, the medical record of nephropathy, waist-to-hip ratio, the medical record of hypertension, work-place related exercise and age. The sequences of importance were almost the same between the two while the difference could partly be explained by the interaction among risk factors through log-linear model.

METHODS: The data of the incidence of hepatitis A in Liaoning Province from 1981 to 2001 were obtained from Liaoning Disease Control and Prevention Center. We used the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model of time series analysis to determine whether there was any autoregression phenomenon in the data. Then the data of the incidence were switched into [0,1] intervals as the network theoretical output. The data from 1981 to 1997 were used as the training and verifying sets and the data from 1998 to 2001 were made up into the test set. STATISTICA neural network (ST NN) was used to construct, train and simulate the artificial neural network.
RESULTS: Twenty-four networks were tested and seven were retained. The best network we found had excellent performance, its regression ratio was 0.73, and its correlation was 0.69. There were 2 input variables in the network, one was AR(1), and the other was time. The number of units in hidden layer was 3.

An ensemble is a 'committee' of neural networks that usually outperforms single neural networks. Bronchiolitis is a common manifestation of viral lower respiratory tract infection in infants and toddlers.
OBJECTIVE: To train artificial neural network ensembles to predict the disposition and length of stay in children presenting to the Emergency Department with bronchiolitis.
METHODS: A specifically constructed database of 119 episodes of bronchiolitis was used to train, validate, and test a neural network ensemble. We used EasyNN 7.0 on a 200 Mhz pentium PC with a maths co-processor. The ensemble of neural networks constructed was subjected to fivefold validation. Comparison with actual and predicted dispositions was measured using the kappa statistic for disposition and the Kaplan-Meier estimations and log rank test for predictions of length of stay.
RESULTS: The neural network ensembles correctly predicted disposition in 81% (range 75-90%) of test cases. When compared with actual disposition the neural network performed similarly to a logistic regression model and significantly better than various 'dumb machine' strategies with which we compared it. The prediction of length of stay was poorer, 65% (range 60-80%), but the difference between observed and predicted lengths of stay were not significantly different.

It is an important and popular topic in environmental science, as concerns have been raised about the health impacts caused by unacceptable ambient air pollutant levels. Of greatest concern are metropolitan cities like Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, respirable suspended particulates (RSP), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are major air pollutants due to the dominant usage of diesel fuel by commercial vehicles and buses. Hence, the study of the influence and the trends relating to these pollutants is extremely significant to the public health and the image of the city. The use of neural network techniques to predict trends relating to air pollutants is regarded as a reliable and cost-effective method for the task of prediction. The works reported here involve developing an improved neural network model that combines both the principal component analysis technique and the radial basis function network and forecasts pollutant tendencies based on a recorded database. Compared with general neural network models, the proposed model features a more simple network architecture, a faster training speed, and a more satisfactory prediction performance. The improved model was evaluated with hourly time series of RSP, NOx and NO2 concentrations monitored at the Mong Kok Roadside Gaseous Monitory Station in Hong Kong during the year 2000 and proved to be effective.

Over the years the scope of the study has expanded to include offspring and other family members of the original cohort, marker data useful for gene mapping and information on other diseases. As a result, it is a rich resource for many areas of research going beyond the original goals. As part of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 13, we used data from the study to evaluate the ability of neural networks to use CVD risk factors as training data for predictions of normal and high blood pressure.
RESULTS: Applying two different strategies to the coding of CVD risk data as risk factors (one longitudinal and one independent of time), we found that neural networks could not be trained to clearly separate individuals into normal and high blood pressure groups. When training was successful, validation was not, suggesting over-fitting of the model. When the number of parameters was reduced, training was not as good. An analysis of the input data showed that the neural networks were, in fact, finding consistent patterns, but that these patterns were not correlated with the presence or absence of high blood pressure.
CONCLUSION: Neural network analysis, applied to risk factors for CVD in the Framingham data, did not lead to a clear classification of individuals into groups with normal and high blood pressure. Thus, although high blood pressure may itself be a risk factor for CVD, it does not appear to be clearly predictable using observations from a set of other CVD risk factors.",0.11307514350003152,other,Unknown

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one of 167 patients with calvarial lesions were found to have metastasis. Clinical and computed tomography data were used for LR and neural network models. Both models were tested with the leave-one-out method. The final results of each model were compared using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (Az).
RESULTS: The neural network identified metastasis significantly more successfully than LR with an Az of 0.9324 +/- 0.0386 versus 0.9192 +/- 0.0373, P = .01. The most important features selected by the LR and neural network were age and edge definition.

We compared six different methods to one constructed by expert opinion, in their brevity and predictive power. The methods include logistic regression and neural networks, with standard and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) variable selection, as well as decision trees with and without boosting. These methods were applied to the baseline data of a subgroup of subjects in a dementia study, using their screening interview items to predict their clinical diagnosis of normal or non-normal (cognitively impaired or demented). The derived models were then validated on a different subgroup of subjects in the same study who had the screening and clinical diagnosis two to five years later. Performance of different models was compared based on their sensitivity and specificity in the validation sample. Generally, the six statistical methods performed slightly to moderately better than the expert-opinion model. Neural networks generally performed better than the logistic and decision tree models. LASSO improved the performance of logistic and neural network models, but it eliminated few input variables in the neural network. The single decision tree performed at least as well as the standard logistic model, and with fewer items, making it an attractive pre-screening tool. Using the boosting option for decision trees did not substantially improve the performance. We recommend that for each situation, different methods of classification should be attempted to obtain optimal results for a given purpose.",0.1585248264234135,other,"logistic regression, decision tree"

METHODS: Learning vector quantification neural network (LVQNN) and discriminate analysis were applied to data from epidemiological survey in a mine in 1996.
RESULTS: The structure of LVQNN was 25-->13-->3. The total veracity rates was 96.98%, and 92.45% among the abnormal blood glucose individuals. Through stepwise discriminate analysis, the discriminate equations were established including 11 variables with a total veracity rate of 87.34%, but was 85.53% in the abnormal blood glucose individuals. Further analysis on 30 cases with missing values showed that the disagreement ratio of LVQ was 1/30, lower than that of discriminate analysis of 7/30.

We aimed to evaluate whether artificial neural networks could improve the diagnostic accuracy.
METHODS: The database of the case-control Lipodystrophy Case Definition Study was split into 504 subjects (265 with and 239 without lipodystrophy) used for training and 284 independent subjects (152 with and 132 without lipodystrophy) used for validation. Back-propagation neural networks with one or two middle layers were trained and validated. Results were compared against logistic regression models using the same information.
RESULTS: Neural networks using clinical variables only (41 items) achieved consistently superior performance than logistic regression in terms of specificity, overall accuracy and area under the ROC curve. Their average sensitivity and specificity were 72.4 and 71.2%, as compared with 73.0 and 62.9% for logistic regression, respectively (area under the ROC curve, 0.784 vs 0.748). The discriminating performance of the neural networks was largely unaffected when built excluding 13 parameters that patients may not have readily available. The average sensitivity and specificity of the neural networks remained the same when metabolic variables were also considered (total 60 items) without a clear advantage against logistic regression (overall accuracy 71.8%). The performance of networks considering also body composition variables was similar to that of logistic regression (overall accuracy 78.5% for both).
CONCLUSIONS: Neural networks may offer a means to improve the discriminating performance for HIV lipodystrophy, when only clinical data are available and a rapid approximate diagnostic decision is needed. In this context, information on metabolic parameters is apparently not helpful in improving the diagnosis of HIV lipodystrophy, unless imaging and body composition studies are also obtained.",0.10779165780795587,other,logistic regression

This can be challenging when the underlying model of the data is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine whether optimizing neural network architecture using genetic programming as a machine learning strategy would improve the ability of neural networks to model and detect nonlinear interactions among genes in studies of common human diseases.
RESULTS: Using simulated data, we show that a genetic programming optimized neural network approach is able to model gene-gene interactions as well as a traditional back propagation neural network. Furthermore, the genetic programming optimized neural network is better than the traditional back propagation neural network approach in terms of predictive ability and power to detect gene-gene interactions when non-functional polymorphisms are present.

One approach is to determine a phenotype associated with recurrence. We compared 2 methods of analyzing such data. Pathologic data from a large clinical trial was analyzed for 403 patients. The outcome modeled was disease recurrence. The results from logistic regression analysis and a neural network approach are compared with respect to receiver operator characteristic plots, which estimate the fit of the model.

Due to the complexity of this problem, we developed Artificial Intelligence based tools/Neural Network (NN) to optimally evaluate outcomes of therapy and predict morbidity and mortality. To further validate the accuracy of these tools, we challenged their performance with that of Cox regression modeling (RM). Our study population involved 116 HIV+ individuals who consistently maintained CD4+ count < 50 cells/mL for over 6 months. All patients were treated with antiretrovirals.

Our objective is to use several statistical models to identify predictors of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) deterioration and develop an algorithm to predict GFR 4 years after the initial evaluation.
METHODS: All records (n = 86) were randomly assigned to a training set (n = 60) and a testing set (n = 26). Linear regression, generalized additive, tree-based, and artificial neural network models were used to identify predictors of outcome and develop a prediction algorithm.
RESULTS: Proteinuria remained the single most important predictor of long-term renal function; other predictors included baseline GFR, blood pressure, plasma renin activity, lipid profile, age, weight/body mass index, and diabetes duration. All four models achieved a good correlation (r = 0.73 to 0.78) between observed and predicted 4-year GFRs on a separate (testing) data set. Best results in predicting the value of GFR were achieved using a tree-based model with six terminal nodes (r = 0.78; root mean squared prediction error = 38.9). The tree-based and generalized additive models achieved high positive (91%) and negative (100%) predictive values in identifying subjects, who developed depressed GFRs in 4 years. An artificial neural network achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.91).
CONCLUSION: GFR depression within 4 years can be predicted with a precision that suggests potential clinical utility.

The efficiency of these classifiers depends upon a number of factors including network training. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of evidence available to enable specific design choices to be made and as a consequence, many designs are made on the basis of trial and error. In this study we develop prediction models to indicate the point at which training should stop for Neural Network based Electrocardiogram classifiers in order to ensure maximum generalisation.
METHODS: Two prediction models have been presented; one based on Neural Networks and the other on Genetic Programming. The inputs to the models were 5 variable training parameters and the output indicated the point at which training should stop. Training and testing of the models was based on the results from 44 previously developed bi-group Neural Network classifiers, discriminating between Anterior Myocardial Infarction and normal patients.
RESULTS: Our results show that both approaches provide close fits to the training data; p = 0.627 and p = 0.304 for the Neural Network and Genetic Programming methods respectively. For unseen data, the Neural Network exhibited no significant differences between actual and predicted outputs (p = 0.306) while the Genetic Programming method showed a marginally significant difference (p = 0.047).

The objective is to improve upon the current approaches to liver transplant outcome prediction by developing a more complete model that takes into account not only the preoperative risk assessment, but also the early postoperative history.
METHODS: A 6-fold cross-validation procedure was used to measure the performance of the networks. The data set was divided into a learning set and a test set by maintaining the same proportion of positive and negative cases in the original set. The effects of network complexity on overfitting were investigated by constructing two types of networks with different numbers of hidden units. For each type of network, 10 individual networks were trained on the learning set and used to form a committee. The performance of the networks was measured exhaustively with respect to both the entire training and test sets.
RESULTS: The networks were capable of learning the time series problem and achieved good performances of 90% correct classification on the learning set and 78% on the test set. The prediction accuracy increases as more information becomes progressively available after the operation with the daily improvement of 10% on the learning set and 5% on the test set.

RESULTS: During follow-up, 13 (3.2%) patients died suddenly and 11(2.5%) had sustained ventricular tachycardia. The neural network showed that the combination best predicting arrhythmic events included: left ventricular failure during coronary care stay, ventricular dyskinesis, late potentials, number of ventricular premature depolarizations/hour, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, left ventricular ejection fraction, bundle branch block and digoxin therapy at discharge. The neural network algorithm allowed identification of a small high-risk patient subgroup (12% of the study population) with an arrhythmic event rate of 46%. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 96 and 93% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, in postinfarction patients, it is possible to predict early and accurately arrhythmic events by noninvasive variables easily obtainable in most patients. Patients identified as being at risk are candidates for prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy.",0.10671088210001062,other,Unknown

The mortality rate from asthma in children aged 5 to 14 years has nearly doubled, from 1.7 deaths per million to 3.2 deaths per million between 1980 and 1993.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to rate problem-based strategies for asthma management in a defined population of children.
METHODS: The participants in our study were recruited from a local inner-city medical facility in Los Angeles. The majority of participants had received the diagnosis of mild-to-moderate-persistent asthma. Each participant was given 10 asthma-based problems and asked to manage them. Each management decision and its order were entered into a database. This database was used to train an artificial neural network (ANN). The trained ANN was then used to cluster the various performances, and outputs were evaluated graphically.
RESULTS: Three hundred five performances were analyzed through our trained neural network. Our ANN classified five major clusters representing different approaches to solving an acute asthma case.
CONCLUSIONS: ANNs can build rich models of complex phenomena through a training and pattern-recognition process. Such networks can solve classification problems with ill-defined categories in which the patterns are deeply hidden within the data, and models of behavior are not well defined. In our pilot study, we have shown that ANNs can be useful in automating evaluation and improving our understanding of how children manage their asthma.",0.10986833094589735,other,Unknown

It is not known, however, if linear statistical models provide optimal results. Artificial intelligence techniques can answer this question and also determine the most important predictor variables.
METHODS: An artificial neural network, using 16 anatomic and physiologic predictor variables, was compared with the latest United Kingdom version of TRISS model.
RESULTS: Both methods were 89.6% correct, but TRISS was significantly better by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.941 vs. 0.921, p < 0.001). The artificial neural network, however, was better calibrated to the test data (Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic, 58.3 vs. 105.4). Head injury, age, and chest injury were the most important predictors by linear or nonlinear methods, whereas respiration rate, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure were underused.
CONCLUSION: Prediction using linear statistics is adequate but not optimal. Only half the predictors have important predictive value, fewer still when using linear classification. The strongest predictors swamp any nonlinearity observed in other variables.",0.11361491732167305,other,Unknown

METHODS: A final diagnosis of asthma can be made only after full clinical assessment but limited resources make it impossible to offer this to complete populations as part of a screening programme. Prioritisation is required so that review can be offered most promptly to those most in need. A stratified random sample of 180 from 6825 respondents to a community survey underwent clinical review. They were categorised according to likelihood of asthma by three independent experts whose opinions were combined into a single probability label for each patient. A neural network was trained to relate questionnaire responses to probability labels. The trained network was applied to the whole community to produce a ranking order based on likelihood of asthma. A screening threshold could then be set to correspond to available resources, and patients above this level with no recorded evidence of asthma diagnosis could be assessed clinically. Using the known probability labels from the training set, it was possible to derive the expected proportion of true asthmatics in any set of patients.
RESULTS: If the screening threshold had been set to capture the top 10% of the ranked population (n = 683), then 239 patients above this threshold had no evidence of diagnosis and would need assessment. Of these, it would be expected that 74% would have the diagnosis confirmed.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach allows prioritisation of a population where resources for diagnostic examination are limited.",0.11862314668608419,other,Unknown

A number of different neural-net-based techniques have been proposed (by us and others) in addition to a standard statistical technique, and we add a technique based on inductively generated decision trees. The salience of the features that compose a proposed set is an important problem to solve efficiently and effectively, not only for neural computing technology but also in order to provide a sound basis for any attempt to design an optimal computational system. The focus of this study is the efficiency and the effectiveness with which high-salience subsets of features can be identified in the context of ill-understood and potentially noisy real-world data.

We then sought to compare the performance of these simplified models with those of full logistic regression and neural network models. From January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1999, data were collected on 4,264 consecutive interventional procedures at a single center. Risk score models were derived from multiple logistic regression models using the first 2,804 cases and then validated on the final 1,460 cases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the risk score model that predicted death was 0.86 compared with 0.85 for the multiple logistic model and 0.83 for the neural network model (validation set). For the combined end points of death, myocardial infarction, or bypass surgery, the corresponding areas under the ROC curves were 0.74, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively. Previously identified risk factors were confirmed in this analysis. The use of stents was associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital complications. Thus, risk score models can accurately predict the risk of major in-hospital complications after PCI. Their discriminatory power is comparable to those of logistic models and neural network models. Accurate bedside risk stratification may be achieved with these simple models.",0.15714824841394398,other,logistic regression

In this study ANN is applied to data from a verbal autopsy study as a means of classifying cause of death.
METHODS: A simulated ANN was trained on a subset of verbal autopsy data, and the performance was tested on the remaining data. The performance of the ANN models were compared to two other classification methods (physician review and logistic regression) which have been tested on the same verbal autopsy data.
RESULTS: Artificial neural network models were as accurate as or better than the other techniques in estimating the cause-specific mortality fraction (CSMF). They estimated the CSMF within 10% of true value in 8 out of 16 causes of death. Their sensitivity and specificity compared favourably with that of data-derived algorithms based on logistic regression models.
CONCLUSIONS: Cross-validation is crucial in preventing the over-fitting of the ANN models to the training data. Artificial neural network models are a potentially useful technique for classifying causes of death from verbal autopsies.

STUDY DESIGN: We identified 100 failed trials of labor and 300 successful trials of labor in women with a prior cesarean delivery performed at our institution. Information was collected on >70 potential predictors of labor outcomes from the medical records, including demographic, historical, and past obstetric information, as well as information from the index pregnancy. Bivariate analyses comparing women in whom a trial of labor failed with those whose trial succeeded were performed. These initial analyses were used to select variables for inclusion into our muitivariate predictive model. From the same data we trained and tested a neural network, using a back-propagation algorithm. The test characteristics of the multivariate predictive model and the neural network were compared.
RESULTS: From the bivariate analysis a history of substance abuse (adjusted odds ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.80), a successful prior vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.31), cervical dilatation at admission (adjusted odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.88), and the need for labor augmentation (adjusted odds ratio, 2.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-4.06) were ultimately discovered to be important in predicting the likelihood of the success or failure of a trial of labor. With these variables in the predictive model the sensitivity of the derived rule for predicting failure was 77%, the specificity was 65%, and the overall accuracy was 69%. We also built a network using the 4 variables that were included in the final multivariate model. We were unable to achieve the same degree of sensitivity and specificity that we observed with the regression-based predictive model (sensitivity and specificity, 59% and 44%).

This study assessed the power of both techniques to detect women at risk of developing incident CIN III; that is, CIN III detected during the follow up of women with normal cytology and borderline nuclear changes.
METHODS: A cohort of 2250 women, 34-54 years of age, who attended population based cervical cancer screening from 1988 to 1991 and had normal smears or borderline nuclear changes was followed. All smears were tested for high risk HPV and the smears were rescreened using neural network based screening. The value of neural network based screening for predicting incident CIN III during a mean follow up period of 6.4 years was compared with that of high risk HPV testing. In addition, morphological markers presumed to be related to HPV were correlated with HPV status.
RESULTS: Thirteen (0.6%) women had incident CIN III. Both high risk HPV positivity and abnormal cytology were associated with an increased risk for incident CIN III (odds ratio, 240 and 22, respectively) and high risk HPV positivity was associated with abnormal cytology. The sensitivity of high risk HPV testing for predicting incident CIN III was much higher than that of neural network based screening (92% and 46%, respectively). None of the morphological markers assessed, including koilocytosis, was correlated with high risk HPV status.
CONCLUSION: High risk HPV testing is superior to neural network based screening in identifying women at risk of developing CIN III.

The inputs to the neural network include classical factors such as grading, age, tumor size, estrogen and progesterone receptor measurements, as well as tumor biological markers such as PAI-1 and uPA. The network learns the structural relationship between these factors and the follow-up data. Examples of neural models for relapse-free survival are presented, which are based on data from 784 breast cancer patients who received their primary therapy at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Technische Universität München, Germany. The performance of the neural analysis as quantified by various indicators (likelihood, Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests) was very high. For example, dividing the patients into two equally sized groups based on the neural score (i.e., cutoff = median score) leads to an estimated difference in relapse-free survival of 40% or better (80% vs. 40%) after 10 years in Kaplan-Meier analysis. Evidence for factor interactions as well as for time-varying impacts is presented. The neural network weights included in the models are significant at the 5% level. The use of neural network analysis and scoring in combination with strong tumor biological factors such as uPA and PAI-1 appears to result in a very effective risk group discrimination. Considerable additional comparison of data from different patient series will be required to establish the generalization capability more firmly. Nonetheless, the improvement of risk group discrimination represents an important step toward the use of neural networks for decision support in a clinical framework and in making the most of biological markers.",0.2960531573643327,other,Unknown

This is largely attributable to differences in case mix. The aim of this study was to identify and evaluate a set of prognostic variables that would accurately predict outcome for individual patients from perioperative indices.
METHODS: perioperative factors associated with subsequent mortality at our institution were identified by retrospective review of 102 consecutive operations for RAAA over a 7-year period (January 1990 to January 1997). Logistic regression analysis was used to select the most significant variables associated with subsequent mortality. These were used to construct, train, and validate a neural network designed to predict survival from surgery in individual cases on a prospective basis.
RESULTS: the 30-day mortality rate was 53%. Multivariate analysis identified four highly significant independent predictors of mortality; preoperative hypotension, intraperitoneal rupture, preoperative coagulopathy, and preoperative cardiac arrest. Using these inputs, the neural network correctly predicted outcome in 82.5% of individual cases.
CONCLUSION: a neural network based on just four perioperative variables can accurately predict outcome of RAAA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1903 LUTS patients referred to the University Hospital Nijmegen between 1992 and 1998 received routine investigation, consisting of transrectal ultrasonography of the prostate, serum PSA measurement, assessment of symptoms and quality of life by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), urinary flowmetry with determination of maximum flow rate (Qmax), voided volume and post-void residual urine and full pressure flow studies (PFS). Using a three-layered backpropagation ANN with three hidden nodes, the outcome of PFS, quantified by the Abrams-Griffiths number (AG-number), was estimated based on all available non-invasive diagnostic test results plus patient age. The performance of the network was quantified using sensitivity, specificity and the area under the ROC-curve (AUC). The results of the neural network approach were compared to those of a linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: Prostate volume, Qmax, voided volume and post void residual urine showed substantial predictive value concerning the outcome of PFS. Patient age, PSA-level, IPSS and Quality of life did not add to that prediction. Using a cut-off value in predicted and true AG-numbers of 40 cm. H2O, the neural network approach yielded sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 69%, respectively. The AUC of the network was 0.75 (standard error = 0.01). A linear regression model produced identical results.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that at an individual level, the outcome of PFS cannot be predicted accurately by the available non-invasive tests. The use of ANNs, which are better able than traditional regression models to identify non-linear relations and complex interactions between variables, did not improve the prediction of BOO. Thus, if precise urodynamic information is considered important in the diagnosis of men with LUTS, PFS must be carried out. Both neural networks and regression analysis appear promising to identify patients who should undergo PFS, and those in whom PFS can safely be omitted. Furthermore, the ability of ANNs and regression models to predict treatment result should be evaluated.",0.14677857217755552,other,linear regression

10575312,Artificial neural networks applied to survival prediction in breast cancer,"Lundin M, Lundin J, Burke HB, Toikkanen S, Pylkkänen L, Joensuu H.",Oncology. 1999 Nov;57(4):281-6. doi: 10.1159/000012061.,Lundin M,Oncology,1999,1999/11/27,,,10.1159/000012061,"In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of a neural network in predicting 5-, 10- and 15-year breast-cancer-specific survival. A series of 951 breast cancer patients was divided into a training set of 651 and a validation set of 300 patients. Eight variables were entered as input to the network: tumor size, axillary nodal status, histological type, mitotic count, nuclear pleomorphism, tubule formation, tumor necrosis and age. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used as a measure of accuracy of the prediction models in generating survival estimates for the patients in the independent validation set. The AUC values of the neural network models for 5-, 10- and 15-year breast-cancer-specific survival were 0.909, 0.886 and 0.883, respectively. The corresponding AUC values for logistic regression were 0.897, 0.862 and 0.858. Axillary lymph node status (N0 vs. N+) predicted 5-year survival with a specificity of 71% and a sensitivity of 77%. The sensitivity of the neural network model was 91% at this specificity level. The rate of false predictions at 5 years was 82/300 for nodal status and 40/300 for the neural network. When nodal status was excluded from the neural network model, the rate of false predictions increased only to 49/300 (AUC 0. 877). An artificial neural network is very accurate in the 5-, 10- and 15-year breast-cancer-specific survival prediction. The consistently high accuracy over time and the good predictive performance of a network trained without information on nodal status demonstrate that neural networks can be important tools for cancer survival prediction.",0.31975529222550103,other,logistic regression

Accurate assessment in identifying index cases of active TB is essential in preventing transmission of the disease.
OBJECTIVES: To develop an artificial neural network using clinical and radiographic information to predict active pulmonary TB at the time of presentation at a health-care facility that is superior to physicians' opinion.
DESIGN: Nonconcurrent prospective study.
SETTING: University-affiliated hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: A derivation group of 563 isolation episodes and a validation group of 119 isolation episodes.
INTERVENTIONS: A general regression neural network (GRNN) was used to develop the predictive model.
MEASUREMENTS: Predictive accuracy of the neural network compared with clinicians' assessment.
RESULTS: Predictive accuracy was assessed by the c-index, which is equivalent to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The GRNN significantly outperformed the physicians' prediction, with calculated c-indices (+/- SEM) of 0.947 +/- 0.028 and 0.61 +/- 0.045, respectively (p < 0.001). When the GRNN was applied to the validation group, the corresponding c-indices were 0. 923 +/- 0.056 and 0.716 +/- 0.095, respectively.

This network is based on features extracted from chest radiographs and clinical parameters. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of the output from the artificial neural network on radiologists' diagnostic accuracy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The artificial neural network was designed to differentiate among 11 interstitial lung diseases using 10 clinical parameters and 16 radiologic findings. Thirty-three clinical cases (three cases for each lung disease) were selected. In the observer test, chest radiographs were viewed by eight radiologists (four attending physicians and four residents) with and without network output, which indicated the likelihood of each of the 11 possible diagnoses in each case. The radiologists' performance in distinguishing among the 11 interstitial lung diseases was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with a continuous rating scale.
RESULTS: When chest radiographs were viewed in conjunction with network output, a statistically significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy was achieved (p < .0001). The average area under the ROC curve was .826 without network output and .911 with network output.
CONCLUSION: An artificial neural network can provide a useful ""second opinion"" to assist radiologists in the differential diagnosis of interstitial lung disease using chest radiographs.",0.2940102818814352,other,Unknown

A challenge that remains is to better understand the behavior of these techniques in effort to know when they will be effective tools. Theoretically they may overcome limitations of the traditional multivariable survival technique, the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Experiments were designed to test whether the new tools would, in practice, overcome these limitations. Two datasets in which theory suggests CART and the neural network should outperform the Cox model were selected. The first was a published leukemia dataset manipulated to have a strong interaction that CART should detect. The second was a published cirrhosis dataset with pronounced nonlinear effects that a neural network should fit. Repeated sampling of 50 training and testing subsets was applied to each technique. The concordance index C was calculated as a measure of predictive accuracy by each technique on the testing dataset. In the interaction dataset, CART outperformed Cox (P < 0.05) with a C improvement of 0.1 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.12). In the nonlinear dataset, the neural network outperformed the Cox model (P < 0.05), but by a very slight amount (0.015). As predicted by theory, CART and the neural network were able to overcome limitations of the Cox model. Experiments like these are important to increase our understanding of when one of these new techniques will outperform the standard Cox model. Further research is necessary to predict which technique will do best a priori and to assess the magnitude of superiority.",0.19646141946644508,other,Unknown

We considered an easily implementable approach with a fast selection criteria of the best configurations. Examples on data sets from two clinical trials are provided.

The ability to identify patients likely to respond would be helpful in making recommendations for treatment. In this statistical analysis we included 82 patients with chronic hepatitis B who received interferon-alpha in clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health between 1984 and 1991. A response was defined as the loss of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) within 1 year of therapy. Multiple clinical parameters measured at pretreatment (month 0) and after the first month (month 1) of therapy were selected by stepwise regression to support the development of the prognostic models: the two-stage logistic regression model and a neural network that utilized higher-order non-linear interactions between variables. Among the 82 patients, 24 (29%) were responders. The two-stage logistic model using pretreatment variables: sex, hepatic fibrosis and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels correctly identified 61% of responders and 76% of non-responders. When HBV DNA at month 1 along with sex, initial ALT and fibrosis was included, the resultant model correctly identified 69% of responders and 77% of non-responders. The neural network, by incorporating interactions between variables, correctly identified 77% and 86% of responders, and 87% and 92% of non-responders, using pretreatment factors alone and the combination of pretreatment and month 1 factors respectively.

METHODS: Neural network and logistic regression models were developed using a training set of 4,782 patients undergoing CABG surgery in Ontario, Canada, in 1991, and they were validated in two test sets of 5,309 and 5,517 patients having CABG surgery in 1992 and 1993, respectively.
RESULTS: The probabilities predicted from a fully trained neural network were similar to those of a ""saturated"" regression model, with both models detecting all possible interactions in the training set and validating poorly in the two test sets. A second neural network was developed by cross-validating a network against a new set of data and terminating network training early to create a more generalizable model. A simple ""main effects"" regression model without any interaction terms was also developed. Both of these models validated well, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.78 and 0.77 (p > 0.10) in the 1993 test set. The predictions from the two models were very highly correlated (r=0.95).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four diagnostic strategies were explored to help define the diagnostic role of neural networks in patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism in whom nondiagnostic ventilation-perfusion lung scans were obtained. First, a network was used to determine which patients could be directly referred for treatment without angiography. Second, the network was applied to determine in which patients treatment could be withheld. Third, the network was used to distinguish patients in whom the network gave indeterminate responses and who should proceed to angiography. Each strategy was compared with use of angiography in terms of morbidity, mortality, and cost per life saved.
RESULTS: The use of the neural network reduced the average cost per patient by more than one-half relative to the cost of angiography. Morbidity and mortality rates were also comparable to or lower than those associated with angiography. The results were consistent regardless of the prevalence of disease.
CONCLUSION: The use of neural networks in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is a promising way to improve cost-effectiveness in the care of patients with nondiagnostic lung scans.",0.2178931584149241,other,Unknown

A PNN is a supervised, three-layer, artificial neural network that classifies input patterns (e.g., physiological data) into specific output categories (e.g., ascites or no ascites). The PNN inputs were O2 level in the blood, body weight, electrocardiogram (ECG), hematocrit, S wave, and heart rate of individual birds. These data were from three experiments that have been described previously (Roush et al., 1996a,b). The three data sets were pooled into a combined data set for a total of 170 observations. From the pooled data, a training set (117 birds), a calibration set (17 birds), and a verification set (36 birds) were extracted. The PNN was trained on the training data set. To prevent the PNN from overfitting the training data, the neural network was evaluated on its ability to make correct predictions of the calibration data set. At the point at which the neural network made the highest number of correct classifications for the calibration data set, the trained neural network was saved on the computer. When the PNN was applied to the complete data set, the sensitivity or proportion of the birds with ascites that the PNN correctly diagnosed was 0.97 (75/77 birds). The specificity or proportion of birds that the PNN made a correct diagnosis of not having ascites was 0.98 (91/93 birds). When the PNN was applied to the verification data set, which was not subjected to neural network training, the sensitivity was 0.95 (19/20) and the specificity was 0.88 (14/16 birds).

They permit the recognition of patterns in complex biological data sets that cannot be detected with conventional linear statistical analysis. One such complex problem is the prediction of outcome for individual patients treated for colorectal cancer. Predictions of outcome in such patients have traditionally been based on population statistics. However, these predictions have little meaning for the individual patient. We report the training of neural networks to predict outcome for individual patients from one institution and their predictive performance on data from a different institution in another region.
METHODS: 5-year follow-up data from 334 patients treated for colorectal cancer were used to train and validate six neural networks designed for the prediction of death within 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months. The previously trained 12-month neural network was then applied to 2-year follow-up data from patients from a second institution; outcome was concealed. No further training of the neural network was undertaken. The network's predictions were compared with those of two consultant colorectal surgeons supplied with the same data.
FINDINGS: All six neural networks were able to achieve overall accuracy greater than 80% for the prediction of death for individual patients at institution 1 within 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months. The mean sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 88%. When the neural network trained to predict death within 12 months was applied to data from the second institution, overall accuracy of 90% (95% CI 84-96) was achieved, compared with the overall accuracy of the colorectal surgeons of 79% (71-87) and 75% (66-84).
INTERPRETATION: The neural networks were able to predict outcome for individual patients with colorectal cancer much more accurately than the currently available clinicopathological methods. Once trained on data from one institution, the neural networks were able to predict outcome for patients from an unrelated institution.",0.247947942684579,other,Unknown

METHODS: The applicability of multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP) to coronary artery bypass grafting risk prediction was assessed using The Society of Thoracic Surgeons database of 80,606 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting in 1993. The results of traditional logistic regression and Bayesian analysis were compared with single-layer (no hidden layer), two-layer (one hidden layer), and three-layer (two hidden layer) MLP neural networks. These networks were trained using stochastic gradient descent with early stopping. All prediction models used the same variables and were evaluated by training on 40,480 patients and cross-validation testing on a separate group of 40,126 patients. Techniques were also developed to calculate effective odds ratios for MLP networks and to generate confidence intervals for MLP risk predictions using an auxiliary ""confidence MLP.""
RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic curve areas for predicting mortality were approximately 76% for all classifiers, including neural networks. Calibration (accuracy of posterior probability prediction) was slightly better with a two-member committee classifier that averaged the outputs of a MLP network and a logistic regression model. Unlike the individual methods, the committee classifier did not overestimate or underestimate risk for high-risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: A committee classifier combining the best neural network and logistic regression provided the best model calibration, but the receiver operating characteristic curve area was only 76% irrespective of which predictive model was used.",0.14436957593659744,other,logistic regression

To determine if neural network modeling would improve outcome prediction compared with standard logistic regression analysis and to determine if data available 24 h after severe head injury allows better prediction than data obtained within 6 h, we tested the ability of both techniques at these two times to predict outcome (dead versus alive) at 6 months. One thousand sixty-six consecutive patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 8 or less during the first 24 h after injury were randomly divided into two groups. Data from the first group (n = 799) were used to develop the models; data from the second group (n = 267) were used to test the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the models by comparing predicted and actual outcomes. The 6-month mortality rate was 63.5%. Our findings confirm the importance of age, Glasgow Coma Scale scores, and hypotension in predicting outcome. Using data available at 24 h improved the predictive power of both models compared with admission data; at both time points, however, the differences in the results obtained with the two models were negligible. We conclude that outcome (dead versus alive) at 6 months after severe head injury can be predicted with logistic regression or neural network models based on data available at 24 h. Critical therapeutic decisions, such as cessation of therapy, should be based on the patient's status 1 day after injury and only rarely on admission status alone.",0.10368758652096921,other,logistic regression

DESIGN AND SETTING: The PNN model was created using an institutional database obtained as part of routine quality assurance activity. Patient records (from 1991 to 1993) were randomly divided into training (n = 732) and validation (n = 380) sets. The model uses seven variables, each obtainable during routine clinical patient care. After completion of the initial validation phase, newer data (1994) became available and were used as an independent source of validation (n = 365).
PATIENTS: 1,477 consecutive cardiac surgery patients operated on in a teaching hospital during a four-year period (1991-94).
RESULTS: The overall accuracy of the neural network was 91.5% in the training set; it was 92.3% in the validation set.

Input into the expert network consisted of clinical risk factors and thallium-201 stress test data. Clinical risk factor screening alone identified 95 of 189 patients as high risk. These 95 patients underwent thallium-201 stress testing, and 53 had either reversible or fixed defects. The other 42 patients were classified as low risk. This algorithm made up the ""expert system,"" and during the 4-year follow-up period had a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 77%, and accuracy of 78%.

Since the TNM staging system was introduced in the 1950s, new prognostic factors have been identified and new methods for integrating prognostic factors have been developed. This study compares the prediction accuracy of the TNM staging system with that of artificial neural network statistical models.
METHODS: For 5-year survival of patients with breast or colorectal carcinoma, the authors compared the TNM staging system's predictive accuracy with that of artificial neural networks (ANN). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, as applied to an independent validation data set, was the measure of accuracy.
RESULTS: For the American College of Surgeons' Patient Care Evaluation (PCE) data set, using only the TNM variables (tumor size, number of positive regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis), the artificial neural network's predictions of the 5-year survival of patients with breast carcinoma were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.720; ANN, 0.770; P < 0.001). For the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results breast carcinoma data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of 10-year survival were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.692; ANN, 0.730; P < 0.01). For the PCE colorectal data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of the 5-year survival of patients with colorectal carcinoma were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.737; ANN, 0.815; P < 0.001). Adding commonly collected demographic and anatomic variables to the TNM variables further increased the accuracy of the artificial neural network's predictions of breast carcinoma survival (0.784) and colorectal carcinoma survival (0.869).
CONCLUSIONS: Artificial neural networks are significantly more accurate than the TNM staging system when both use the TNM prognostic factors alone. New prognostic factors can be added to artificial neural networks to increase prognostic accuracy further. These results are robust across different data sets and cancer sites.",0.15344017835414336,other,Unknown

For patients with diseases that may extend for several years, in particular, accurate assessment of survival probabilities is essential. New methods, such as neural networks, have been used increasingly to model disease progression. Their advantages and disadvantages, when compared to statistical methods such as Cox proportional hazards, have seldom been explored in real-world data. In this study, we compare the performances of a Cox model and a neural network model that are used as prognostic tools for a set of people living with AIDS. We modeled disease progressions for patients who had AIDS (according to the 1993 CDC definition) in a set of 588 patients in California, using data from the ATHOS project. We divided the study population into 10 training and 10 test sets and evaluated the prognostic accuracy of a Cox proportional hazards model and of a neural network model by determining sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values for an arbitrary threshold (0.5), and the areas under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves that utilized all possible thresholds for intervals of 1 yr following the diagnosis of AIDS. There was no evidence that the Cox model performed better than did the neural network model or vice versa, but the former method had the advantage of providing some insight on which variables were most influential for prognosis.

A flexible computer-based mathematical model which is sensitive to the complexity of intensive care medicine, and which accurately models prognosis, seems highly desirable.
METHODS: We have created, optimised by genetic algorithms, trained, and evaluated the performance of an artificial neural network (ANN) in the clinical setting of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and haemodynamic shock. 258 patients were selected from an intensive care database of 4484 patients at a London teaching hospital and randomised to a network training set (168) and a test set (90). The outcome evaluated was death during that hospital admission and the performance of the neural net was compared (by receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curves and by Brier scores) with that of a logistic regression model.
FINDINGS: Artificial neural network performance increased with successive generations; the best-performing ANN was created after 7 generations and predicted outcome more accurately than the logistic regression model (ROC curve area 0.863 vs 0.753).
INTERPRETATION: In this study, ANNs have lent themselves particularly well to modelling a complex clinical situation; we suggest that this relates to their inherently flexible nature which accommodates interactions between the clinical input fields. In addition, we have demonstrated the value of a second computational technique (genetic algorithms) in ""tuning"" ANN performance. These techniques can potentially be implemented in individual intensive care units; the outcome models which they will generate will be sensitive to local practice. Analysis of such accurate clinical outcome models may empower clinicians with a hitherto unappreciated degree of insight into those elements of their clinical practice which are most relevant to their patients' outcome.",0.14225464251447834,other,logistic regression

BACKGROUND: Artificial neural networks is a computational technique used to represent and process information by means of networks of interconnected processing elements, similar to neurons. They have found applications in medical decision support systems, particularly in prognosis.
METHODS: Clinical and Doppler-derived echocardiographic data from 95 consecutive patients with diffuse impairment of myocardial contractility were studied. After 1 year, data regarding survival or death were obtained and produced the prognostic variable. The data base was divided randomly into a training data set (47 cases, 8 deaths) and a testing data set (48 cases, 7 deaths). Results of artificial neural network classification were compared with those from linear discriminant analysis, clinical judgment and conventional heuristically based programs.
RESULTS: The study group included 57 male (47 survivors) and 38 female patients (33 survivors). Linear discriminant analysis was not efficient for separating survivors from nonsurvivors because the accuracy at the ideal cutoff value was only 67.4%, with a sensitivity of 67.5%, positive predictive value of 27.8% and negative predictive value of 91.5%. In contrast, all artificial neural networks were able to predict outcome with an accuracy of 90%, specificity of 93% and sensitivity of 71.4%, for the best artificial neural network. Both clinical judgment and automatic heuristic methods were also inferior in performance.
CONCLUSIONS: The artificial neural network method has proved to be reliable for implementing quantitative prognosis of mortality in patients with heart failure. Additional studies with larger numbers of patients are required to better assess the usefulness of artificial neural networks.",0.23706132354975604,other,Unknown

Based upon numerical results from the two networks, the program generates an idealized spectrum that contains only a single ion type. From this simplified spectrum, the program's sequencing module, which incorporates a small rule base of fragmentation knowledge, directly generates sequences in a stepwise fashion through a high-speed iterative process.

The CAD scheme first detects nodule candidates from chest radiographs based on a difference image technique. Nine image features characterizing nodules are extracted automatically for each of the nodule candidates. The extracted image features are then used as input data to the classifiers for distinguishing actual nodules from the false-positive detections. The performances of the classifiers are evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic analysis.

Adaptive artificial neural networks were used to identify patients at high risk of valve-related events based on preoperative data. Data from a clinical trial on 789 subjects with Carpentier-Edwards pericardial bioprostheses were used. Patients' records were divided into two groups, one of which was used for training the neural network and the other for testing the trained network and determining error rates. Patient information such as age, sex, NYHA class and anticoagulation therapy, as well as valve information such as size and the date of implant, were used as the network inputs. The neural net had a single output variable indicating the risk that an individual patient would develop a valve-related complication resulting in death. The results show that a trained neural network was able to predict valve-related deaths in the specified time interval of 1981-1991 with a high degree of accuracy. The neural network was also successful in classifying patients into high and low risk categories.",0.2856944156391613,other,Unknown

A NET is a computer construct that can detect complex patterns within a data set. A NET must be ""trained"" by supplying a series of input patterns and the corresponding expected output (e.g., survival). Once trained, the NET can recall the proper outputs for a specific set of inputs. It can also extrapolate correct outputs for patterns never before encountered. A neural network was trained on Revised Trauma Score, Injury Severity Score, age, and survival data contained in 3500 of 8300 state registry records of all patients with penetrating trauma reported in Pennsylvania from 1987 through 1990. The remaining 4800 records were analyzed by TRISS, ASCOT, and the trained NET. Sensitivity (accuracy of predicting death) and specificity (accuracy of predicting survival) were 0.840 and 0.985 for TRISS, 0.842 and 0.985 for ASCOT, and 0.904 and 0.972 for the neural network. This represents a decrease in the number of improperly classified (""unexpected"") deaths, from 73 for TRISS and 72 for ASCOT, to 44 for the neural network. The increased sensitivity was statistically significant by Chi-square analysis. The NET for penetrating trauma provided a more sensitive but less specific technique for calculating Ps than did either TRISS or ASCOT. This translated into a 40% reduction in the number of deaths requiring review, and the potential for more efficient use of quality assurance resources.",0.1469412405333077,other,Unknown

The neural network is a new quantitative method where the fundamental building blocks are units which can be likened to neurons, and weighted connections which can be likened to synapses. The more the hidden units, the more complex the patterns that can be learnt.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from two Dutch studies in ovarian cancer were used to compare the previously reported survival rates predicted by the Cox's prognostic index with the prediction obtained by a neural network.
RESULTS: Both the Cox's analysis and the neural network agreed on residual tumour size, stage, and performance status as being important for survival. The neural network identified additional predictive factors such as place of diagnosis and age. As the Cox's prognostic index has not been tested to predict survival on an independent data set a comparison with the results obtained in the neural network test set could not be performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Neural networks perform at least as well as Cox's method for the prediction of survival, and prognostic factors can easily be identified. The analysis not only revealed the predictive power of some characteristics, but also the non-predictive power of the others.",0.32937933680284004,other,Unknown

Fifteen physiological variables were recorded on day 3 for 422 consecutive patients whose duration of stay was over 72 hours. Two separate models were built using each technique. First, logistic and neural network models were constructed on the complete 422 patient dataset and discrimination was compared. Second, the database was randomly divided into a 284 patient developmental dataset and a 138 patient validation dataset. The developmental dataset was used to construct logistic and neural net models and the predictive power of these models was verified on the validation dataset. On the complete dataset, the neural network clearly outperformed the logistic model (sensitivity and specificity of 1 and .997 vs. .525 and .966, area under ROC curve .9993 vs. .9259), while both performed equally well on the validation dataset (area under ROC of .82). The excellent performance of the neural net on the complete dataset reveals that the problem is classifiable. Since our dataset only contained 40 mortality events, it is highly likely that the validation dataset was not representative of the developmental dataset, which led to a decreased predictive performance by both the neural net and the logistic regression models. Theoretically, given an extensive dataset, the neural network should be able to perform mortality prediction with a sensitivity and a specificity approaching 95%. Clinically, this would be an extremely important achievement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0.21486719757257572,other,logistic regression

Two artificial neural systems have been implemented on a Cray supercomputer for rapid protein/nucleic acid sequence classifications. The neural networks used are three-layered, feed-forward networks that employ back-propagation learning algorithm. The molecular sequences are encoded into neural input vectors by applying an n-gram hashing method or a SVD (singular value decomposition) method. Once trained with known sequences in the molecular databases, the neural system becomes an associative memory capable of classifying unknown sequences based on the class information embedded in its neural interconnections. The protein system, which classifies proteins into PIR (Protein Identification Resource) superfamilies, showed a 82% to a close to 100% sensitivity at a speed that is about an order of magnitude faster than other search methods. The pilot nucleic acid system, which classifies ribosomal RNA sequences according to phylogenetic groups, has achieved a 100% classification accuracy. The system could be used to reduce the database search time and help organize the molecular sequence databases.

The network input consisted of 35 numbers per patient case that represented ultrasonographic data and laboratory tests. The network architecture had 35 elements in the input layer, two hidden layers of 35 elements each, and 5 elements in the output layer. After being trained to a learning tolerance of 1%, the network classified hepatic masses correctly in 48 of 64 cases.

This study aimed to evaluate the possible African swine fever (ASF) distribution using network analysis and a diffusion model through live pig, carcass, and pig product movement data.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Empirical movement data from Thailand for the year 2019 were used, and expert opinions were sought to evaluate network properties and the diffusion model. The networks were presented as live pig movement and carcass movement data at the provincial and district levels. For network analysis, a descriptive network analysis was performed using outdegree, indegree, betweenness, fragmentation, and power law distribution, and cutpoints were used to describe movement patterns. For the diffusion model, we simulated each network using spatially different infected locations, patterns, and initial infection sites. Based on expert opinions, the initial infection site, the probability of ASF occurrence, and the probability of the initial infected adopter were selected for the appropriated network. In this study, we also simulated networks under varying network parameters to predict the infection speed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The total number of movements recorded was 2,594,364. These were divided into 403,408 (403,408/2,594,364; 15.55%) for live pigs and 2,190,956 (2,190,956/2,594,364; 84.45%) for carcasses. We found that carcass movement at the provincial level showed the highest outdegree (mean = 342.554, standard deviation (SD) = 900.528) and indegree values (mean = 342.554, SD = 665.509). In addition, the outdegree and indegree presented similar mean values and the degree distributions of both district networks followed a power-law function. The network of live pigs at provincial level showed the highest value for betweenness (mean = 0.011, SD = 0.017), and the network of live pigs at provincial level showed the highest value for fragmentation (mean = 0.027, SD = 0.005). Our simulation data indicated that the disease occurred randomly due to live pig and carcass movements along the central and western regions of Thailand, causing the rapid spread of ASF. Without control measures, it could spread to all provinces within 5- and 3-time units and in all districts within 21- and 30-time units for the network of live pigs and carcasses, respectively. This study assists the authorities to plan control and preventive measures and limit economic losses caused by ASF.",0.11257651425910514,other,Unknown

In this study, newly diagnosed HIV patients' phylogenetic, clinical and behavioural data were integrated, and an information diffusion model was incorporated in analysing transmission dynamics. A genetic network was constructed from HIV sequences, from which transmission cascades were extracted. From the transmission cascades, CRF01_AE had higher values of information diffusion metrics, including scale, speed and range, than that of B, signifying the distinct transmission patterns of two circulating subtypes in Hong Kong. Patients connected in the network, were more likely male, younger, of main circulating subtypes, to have acquired HIV infection locally, and a higher CD4 level at diagnosis. Genetic connections varied among men who have sex with men (MSM) who used different channels of sex networking and varied in their engagement in risk behaviours. MSM using recreational drugs for sex held positions of greater importance within the network. Significant differences in network metrics were observed among MSM as differentiated by their mobile apps usage patterns, evidencing the impact of social network on transmission networks.

Contacts are usually assumed to be possible only through a network of connected patches. This network accounts for a spatial landscape or a social organization of interactions. Thanks to social network literature, heterogeneous networks of contacts can be considered. A major issue is to assess the influence of the network in the dynamic model. Most work with this common purpose uses deterministic models or an approximation of a stochastic Extinction-Colonisation model (sEC) which are relevant only for large networks. When working with a limited size network, the induced stochasticity is essential and has to be taken into account in the conclusions. Here, a rigorous framework is proposed for limited size networks and the limitations of the deterministic approximation are exhibited. This framework allows exact computations when the number of patches is small. Otherwise, simulations are used and enhanced by adapted simulation techniques when necessary. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare four main topologies of networks in contrasting settings to determine the role of the network. A challenging case was studied in this context: seed exchange of crop species in the Réseau Semences Paysannes (RSP), an emergent French farmers׳ organisation.
